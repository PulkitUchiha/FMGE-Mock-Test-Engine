      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "A patient with HIV presenting with cough and fever raises suspicion of tuberculosis (TB), which is common in immunocompromised individuals. Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) medium is a specialized culture medium used to isolate Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Lab Investigations for TB: 2 Investigatio ns Purpose Advantages Limitations Sputum smear • Initial screening for pulmonary TB. • Samples are stained using the Ziehl-Neelsen method or Auramine-O stain to visualize acid- fast bacilli (AFB) under a microscope. • Quick and inexpensive. Can provide results within a few hours. • Low sensitivit y, especiall y in cases of extrapul monary TB or in patients with HIV. • Cannot differenti ate between Mycobac terium tubercul osis and non- tubercul ous mycobac teria (NTM). Culture Methods • Confirm the diagnosis of TB and assess drug susceptibility. • Solid Media: Sputum is inoculated onto solid culture media like Löwenstein-Jensenor Middlebrook agar. • Liquid Media: Automated systems like BACTEC or MGIT are used to detect growth faster. • The gold standard for TB diagnosis. • Allows for drug susceptibility testing. • Time- consumi ng; results can take weeks. • Requires specializ ed laborator y facilities. 3 Xpert MTB/RIF • Detects Mycobacterium tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance. • Method: • A cartridge- based system that performs nucleic acid amplification (NAAT). • Sputum or other specimens are processed directly in the cartridge. • Rapid results (within 2 hours). • High sensitivity and specificity. • Simultaneousl y detects rifampicin resistance. • More expensiv e than smear microsco py. • Does not provide full drug susceptib ility testing. LAMP (Loop- Mediated Isothermal Amplificati on) • Detects DNA of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. • Method: • Amplifies DNA at a constant temperature without the need for thermal cycling. • Sputum or other specimens are used. • Rapid results (within 1-2 hours). • High specificity and sensitivity. • Can be performed at the point of care. • Used for patients with HIV with CD4+ counts of less than 100 cells/μL irrespective of signs and symptoms of TB. • Less widely available than PCR- based tests. • Cannot detect drug resistanc e directly. 4 TrueNat • Point-of-care test for TB detection. • Method: • Uses a micro- PCR technology to amplify DNA. • Results are available within 60 minutes. • Portable and easy to use in peripheral health facilities. • Provides results quickly, facilitating immediate treatment decisions. Line Probe Assay (LPA) • Detects TB and drug resistance (rifampicin and isoniazid). • Method: • Sputum samples are processed, and DNA is extracted. • Amplified DNA is hybridized to specific probes on a membrane strip. • Rapid results (within 1-2 days). • Can detect multiple mutations associated with drug resistance. • Requires a laborator y setup and trained personne l. • Not suitable for all strains of TB. RFLP • IS6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis is widely used for molecular epidemiological studies of tuberculosis. • Restriction enzymes Nru I, EcoN I, Pst I, and Pvu II were used to analyze IS6110 fingerprints in Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains H37Rv (virulent) and H37Ra (avirulent). Tinsdale medium(Option A) is used for Corynebacterium diphtheriae, which causes diphtheria. MacConkey agar (Option C) is used for gram-negative bacteria, particularly enteric pathogens like E. coli and Klebsiella. Loeffler serum slope (LSS)(Option D) enhances the growth of Corynebacterium diphtheriae. 5",

Nutrient agar Produces large, irregular colonies with a metallic sheen. Peptone water Forms uniform turbidity with surface pellicle. 16 Cetrimide Agar Selective medium that inhibits other Gram-negative bacteria; specifically selected for Pseudomonas aeruginosa; pigment production (e.g., pyocyanin). King’s medium used to increase pigment production by pseudomonas Biochemical Tests Various biochemical tests to identify specific metabolic properties: Oxidase test Positive Catalase test Positive ICUT Test: Indole test Negative Citrate test Positive Urease test Negative Triple sugar test Shows alkaline slant with no gas and hydrogen sulfide. Molecular Methods PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction), 16S rRNA sequencing Provides specific and sensitive detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa DNA. Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing Disk diffusion method, Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) testing Determines the susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to various antibiotics. Klebsiella (Option A): Although Gram-negative, it is oxidase-negative. It does not produce fluorescent pigments under UV light and typically forms mucoid colonies due to its capsule. Staphylococcus aureus (Option B) is Gram-positive, whereas the given organism is Gram- negative. It does not produce fluorescent pigments under UV light and forms golden-yellow colonies, not greenish ones. Serratia (Option D)is Gram-negative and oxidase-negative. Some Serratia species produce red pigment (prodigiosin), but they do not fluoresce under UV light like Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 17",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "In children, the total body surface area (TBSA) percentages differ from adults due to the larger head-to-body ratio. According to the Rule of Nines adjusted for children and the Lund and Browder chart: 62 • The entire head and neck account for approximately 18% of the TBSA in a 3-year-old child. • Each upper limb accounts for approximately 9% of the TBSA. Adding these together: 18% (head and neck) + 9% (one upper limb) = 27% According to the Wallace rule of 9, this is how the area burned is calculated: Adults Children Infants Head & neck 9% 18% 20% Front of chest & abdominal wall 9 x 2 = 18% 18% 10 x 2 = 20% Back of chest & abdominal wall 9 x 2 = 18% 18% 10 x 2 = 20% Lower limb 18 x 2 = 36% 13.5 x 2 = 27% 10 x 2 = 20% Upper limb 9 x 2 = 18% 18% 10 x 2 = 20% Perineum 1% 1% 40-44% (Option B): This value overestimates the burn area. A 40-44% burn would imply involvement of larger or additional body areas beyond the head, neck, and one upper limb, such as parts of the trunk or both upper limbs. 18-20% (Option C): This value roughly corresponds to the head and neck alone, without including the upper limb. Since the upper limb is also involved, the percentage should be higher. 5-10% (Option D): This severely underestimates the burn size. The entire head and neck alone exceed 10%, so including one upper limb must be substantially more.",

Prosthetic Valve Endocarditis: • It occurs following cardiac valve replacement. • Early prosthetic valve endocarditis (occurs within 12 months of valve replacement): • Generally nosocomial. • Results from intra-operative contamination of the prosthesis or a bacteremic postoperative complication. • Common agents: CoNS (e.g., S. epidermidis) and S. aureus. • Late prosthetic valve endocarditis (occurs after 12 months of valve replacement): • Usually community-acquired. • Common agents: Viridans streptococci. • Overall: • Regardless of the time of onset after surgery, CoNS are the most common agents (at least 68-85%). • Majority are methicillin-resistant CoNS. Streptococcus viridans (Option A)is a common cause of native valve endocarditis, particularly following dental procedures or in patients with pre-existing valvular disease. However, it is not the primary cause of prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE), where Staphylococcal species predominate. Staphylococcus aureus (Option C)is a virulent pathogen that causes rapidly progressive (acute) infective endocarditis, affecting both native and prosthetic valves. It is a leading cause of healthcare-associated IE, often seen in intravenous drug users (IVDU) and patients with catheters or implanted devices. While it can cause prosthetic valve IE, it is more common in late-onset cases rather than early PVE. Enterococci (Option D) (e.g., Enterococcus faecalis) are opportunistic pathogens that cause subacute endocarditis, particularly in elderly patients with genitourinary or gastrointestinal infections. Though they can infect prosthetic valves, they are not the primary causative agent. 76",

      "explanation": "The given image depicts a newborn with an open neural tube defect, specifically rachischisis or myeloschisis, which is a severe form of spina bifida where the neural tissue is exposed without skin or meningeal covering. Neural tube defects: Category Details Definition Failure of proper closure of neural tube & covering mesoderm/ectoderm; most common congenital CNS anomaly. Inheritance Primary NTDs have multifactorial inheritance. Maternal risk factors Alcohol, radiation exposure, IDDM, valproate, carbamazepine, zinc and folate deficiency. Types of NTDs Spina bifida occulta, meningocele, encephalocele, myelomeningocele, anencephaly, caudal regression syndrome, dermal sinus, tethered cord, syringomyelia, diastematomyelia, lipoma, iniencephaly. Spina bifida occulta Midline defect of vertebral bodies without protrusion of spinal cord or meninges; usually asymptomatic and not of consequence. Craniorachischisis Rare malformation with skull and spinal bone defects; brain and nerves exposed; may have other defects like imperforate anus. 84 Meningocele Meninges herniate through vertebral arches or sacrum; spinal cord normal. Fluctuant midline mass that may transilluminate. Surgery may be delayed in asymptomatic cases with normal neuro findings and skin covering. Myelomeningocele Most common in lumbosacral region; sac-like cystic structure with neural tissue; 80% develop hydrocephalus with type II Chiari malformation. Anencephaly Large defect of calvarium, meninges, and scalp; associated with rudimentary brain due to failure of closure of rostral neuropore. Iniencephaly Retroflexion of head with occipital and upper spine defects, nearly absent neck; defect can range from acrania to minimal defect. Prenatal diagnosis Detailed ultrasound, MSAFP (maternal serum α-fetoprotein), amniotic fluid acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Prevention 0.4 mg folic acid daily for all women of childbearing age; 4 mg daily for high-risk women (prior affected child). Risk of recurrence 3-4% after 1 affected child; 10% after 2 affected children. Treatment Surgery for defect; VP shunt if hydrocephalus present. Open lesions should be closed within 24 hours. Antibiotics if infection is present. Meningoencephalocele (Option B):",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Muscle weakness due to neuromuscular blockade is not reversed by atropine administration. Atropine is an antimuscarinic (anticholinergic) agent that competitively blocks muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. It has no effect on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction, which are responsible for skeletal muscle contraction. Therefore, atropine cannot reverse muscle weakness caused by neuromuscular blocking agents. Atropine Classification • Anticholinergic drug (Muscarinic receptor antagonist) • Competitive antagonist at muscarinic receptors 94 Mechanism of Action • Competitive inhibition of postganglionic acetylcholine muscarinic receptors • Blocks all subtypes of muscarinic receptors (M₁, M₂, M₃) • Direct vagolytic action leading to parasympathetic inhibition • Allows preexisting sympathetic stimulation to predominate Pharmacological Actions 1. CNS Effects • Overall CNS stimulant action • Stimulates medullary centers (vagal, respiratory, vasomotor) • Depresses vestibular excitation (antimotion sickness property) • Suppresses tremor and rigidity in parkinsonism • High doses: cortical excitation, restlessness, hallucinations, delirium • Very high doses: respiratory depression and coma 2. CVS Heart: • Tachycardia (primary effect) - blocks M₂ receptors on SA node(Option A Ruled Out) • Initial transient bradycardia may occur with IM/SC injection • Abbreviates refractory period of A-V node • Facilitates A-V conduction • Shortens P-R interval Blood Pressure: • No consistent/marked effect on BP • Tachycardia and vasomotor center stimulation tend to raise BP • Histamine release and direct vasodilator action (at high doses) tend to lower BP • Blocks vasodepressor action of cholinergic agonists 95 3. Eye • Mydriasis (pupil dilation) • Cycloplegia (paralysis of accommodation) • Abolition of light reflex • Effects last 7-10 days with topical application • May increase intraocular tension, especially in narrow angle glaucoma • Has mild local anesthetic action on cornea 4. Smooth Muscles • Relaxes all visceral smooth muscles with parasympathetic innervation (M₃ blockade) • Reduces tone and amplitude of GI contractions • Slows passage of chyme; may cause constipation • Causes bronchodilation, reduces airway resistance (Option D Ruled Out) • Relaxes ureter and urinary bladder • Relaxation of biliary tract (less marked) • Minimal effect on uterus 5. Glandular Secretions • Markedly decreases sweat, salivary, tracheobronchial and lacrimal secretions (M₃ blockade) (Option C Ruled Out) 6. Body Temperature • Higher doses can cause rise in body temperature • Due to inhibition of sweating and stimulation of temperature regulating center • Children are highly susceptible to atropine fever Relative Sensitivity of Organs Decreasing order of sensitivity: Saliva, sweat, bronchial secretion > eye, bronchial muscle, heart > smooth muscle of intestine, bladder > gastric glands and smooth muscle",

The child's facial asymmetry, particularly the drooping of one side of the face, suggests a lower motor neuron (LMN) facial nerve (CN VII) palsy, commonly known as Bell’s palsy. Bell’s palsy: Description • Most common cause of facial palsy • Characterized by idiopathic, LMN facial paralysis of acute onset • Most commonly the Labyrinthine segment of facial nerve is involved. • Males and females are equally affected. Aetiology • Idiopathic: Most common cause • Viral Infection: HSV >> Herpes zoster • Vascular Ischemia • Hereditary: Positive family history in 6-8% • Autoimmune Risk Factors • More common in diabetics (due to angiopathy) and pregnant women (due to fluid retention). Clinical Features • Sudden onset of facial paralysis with inability to close the eye (Bell's phenomenon), asymmetry of the face, epiphora, drooping mouth, and dribbling of saliva. • Associated symptoms may include ear pain, noise intolerance (stapedial paralysis), or loss of taste (chorda tympani involvement). 98 Diagnosis • Diagnosis is made by excluding other causes of peripheral facial paralysis. Treatment • General: Reassurance, pain relief, eye protection and physiotherapy • Medical: Prednisolone 60 mg per day for 5 days then reduced by 10 mg per day (for a total treatment time of 10 days) and 50 mg per day (in two divided doses) for 10 days, Acyclovir (Adult doses) • Surgical: Nerve decompression Prognosis • 85%-90% of patients fully recover • Incomplete resolution are mainly seen in recurrent/late recovery cases 3rd N.

Cortex: • The outer, more densely packed region of the thymus. • Filled with immature T cells (thymocytes), undergoing differentiation and maturation as they move towards the medulla. • The cortex contains thymic nurse cells that support the maturing thymocytes. • T cells express surface markers (like TCR, CD3, CD4, and CD8) during maturation. • Macrophages are present to phagocytose apoptotic T cells, which fail to mature properly. 2. Medulla: • The inner, less densely populated region. • Dominated by epithelial cells with pale-staining nuclei and large cytoplasm. • Contains Hassall's corpuscles, concentric structures made of keratinized epithelial cells, involved in T cell regulation. • Dendritic cells and macrophages in the medulla present self-antigens to maturing T cells, ensuring the elimination of self-reactive cells to prevent autoimmunity. Histology of the Thymus: • Epithelial Framework: Throughout the thymus, epithelial cells provide a structural scaffold for lymphocyte development and produce hormones like thymopoietin, which regulate T cell maturation and proliferation. • It is divided into lobules by connective tissue septa. • A protective blood-thymus barrier prevents antigens from entering, safeguarding T cell maturation. With age, the thymus undergoes involution, where lymphoid tissue is replaced by fat, but it continues to produce mature T cells. 120 Tonsil (Option A): Tonsils contain lymphoid follicles with germinal centers. The histology of tonsils features these follicles, unlike the thymus. Lymph node (Option B): Lymph nodes also have lymphoid follicles but have a more defined capsule, cortex, paracortex, and medulla. 121 Spleen (Option C): The spleen has a characteristic red pulp (containing blood) and white pulp (containing lymphocytes)",

The first 24 hours are usually asymptomatic or present with mild symptoms, but a rise in liver enzymes (AST, ALT) occurs as hepatotoxicity begins. Metabolism of Acetaminophen 141 • Acetaminophen is mainly metabolized via phase II reactions into harmless sulfate and glucuronide metabolites. • A small portion undergoes phase I metabolism by CYP2E1, forming the hepatotoxic metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone-imine (NAPQI). Detoxification of NAPQI • NAPQI is neutralized by binding to glutathione, forming water-soluble mercapturic acid, which is excreted via the kidneys. Glutathione Depletion • When excessive NAPQI is produced, or glutathione is depleted, NAPQI binds to hepatocyte macromolecules, forming acetaminophen-protein adducts, causing hepatocyte necrosis. Risk Factors • Chronic alcohol use (induces CYP2E1, depletes glutathione). • Starvation. • Prior use of mixed-function oxidase-inducing drugs (e.g., phenobarbital, INH). • Hepatitis C infection increases the risk of liver injury in overdose. Clinical features Early Symptoms (4-12 hrs): • Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, shock.

      "option_c": "Hypernatremia",
      "option_d": "Hyperphosphatemia",
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The combination of indomethacin (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, NSAID) and an ACE inhibitor increases the risk of hyperkalemia due to their combined effects on renal function and potassium homeostasis. • Mechanism: • ACE inhibitors (e.g., enalapril, lisinopril) block angiotensin-converting enzymes, reducing aldosterone secretion. • Aldosterone promotes potassium excretion, so reduced aldosterone leads to potassium retention. • Indomethacin (NSAID) further reduces renal perfusion by inhibiting prostaglandins, worsening potassium retention. • This can lead to hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), dehydration, or concurrent diuretic use. 146 Drug Interaction Mechanism Clinical Implication ACE Inhibitors + Potassium Supplements/K- sparing diuretics Risk of hyperkalemia due to reduced aldosterone secretion by ACE inhibitors combined with potassium-retaining agents. Monitoring serum potassium levels is crucial to avoid hyperkalemia, which can cause serious cardiac issues such as arrhythmias. ACE Inhibitors + NSAIDs NSAIDs can reduce the anti- hypertensive effects of ACE inhibitors and decrease renal blood flow, increasing the risk of acute renal failure (ARF) or oliguria. Use caution when combining NSAIDs with ACE inhibitors, and closely monitor renal function, particularly in high- risk patients. ACE Inhibitors + Lithium ACE inhibitors can increase the reabsorption of lithium, potentially leading to lithium toxicity. Monitor lithium levels carefully when starting or adjusting ACE inhibitors in patients taking lithium, and adjust the lithium dosage as needed. ACE Inhibitors + Antacids Reduced bioavailability of ACE inhibitors due to binding with antacids. Administer ACE inhibitors at least two hours before or after antacids to maintain their efficacy. ACE Inhibitors + Diuretics Diuretics enhance the hypotensive effects of ACE inhibitors by depleting sodium and raising renin levels. In patients already on diuretics, start ACE inhibitors at a low dose to minimise the risk of excessive blood pressure reduction initially. • Hypercalcemia (Option B) is",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The deterioration of health after starting ART in an HIV-TB co-infected patient is most likely due to Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS), which is caused by immunological changes in response to ART. • Mechanism: • ART restores CD4+ T-cell function and improves the immune response. • This leads to a stronger inflammatory response against pre-existing TB infection, worsening symptoms. • IRIS typically occurs 2–12 weeks after ART initiation. • Clinical Presentation: • Worsening TB symptoms (fever, lymphadenopathy, worsening respiratory symptoms). • New inflammatory lesions (e.g., enlarging TB lymph nodes, worsening pleural effusions). • No evidence of drug resistance. • Management: • Continue both TB treatment and ART. • NSAIDs or corticosteroids may be used for severe cases. • HIV-positive individuals face an 8-fold increased risk of developing TB and are prone to more severe and potentially fatal extrapulmonary TB. • To manage co-infection, ATT is initiated first, followed by ART after 2 weeks to mitigate the risk of Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS), an exaggerated inflammatory response. 154 • Rifampin, a potent CYP inducer in ATT, accelerates the metabolism of certain ART drugs like nevirapine (NNRTI), dolutegravir (integrase inhibitor), and protease inhibitors (e.g., Ritonavir, Indinavir, lopinavir), reducing their effectiveness. However, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and efavirenz can be safely combined with Rifampin. • Rifabutin, a weaker enzyme inducer, is often used as an alternative to mitigate drug interactions in ART. • All HIV-positive TB patients should also receive cotrimoxazole preventive therapy to guard against Pneumocystis jirovecii infection. • Development of drug resistance to TB drugs (Option A) is",

      "explanation": "Tubal (ectopic) pregnancy occurs when a fertilized ovum implants outside the uterine cavity, most commonly in the fallopian tube. The characteristic ultrasound findings suggestive of a tubal pregnancy include: 1. Adnexal mass – Represents the ectopic pregnancy, often seen as a tubal ring or a gestational sac outside the uterus. 2. Empty uterus – Absence of an intrauterine gestational sac despite a positive pregnancy test. 3. Fluid in the pelvis – Suggests hemoperitoneum due to rupture or bleeding from the ectopic site. Ovarian mass with single layer of endometrium (Option A) suggests an ovarian pathology (e.g., corpus luteum cyst), not tubal pregnancy. Adnexal mass with empty uterus (Option B): While this is suggestive, the presence of fluid in the pelvis increases suspicion of rupture. Trilayer endometrium without adnexal mass (Option C): A trilaminar endometrium is seen in normal early pregnancy or luteal phase and does not indicate an ectopic pregnancy.",

      "explanation": "Type 3 Tympanoplasty is performed when the malleus and incus are absent, but the stapes footplate is intact and mobile. The tympanic membrane or graft is placed directly over the stapes head to allow sound conduction. This technique helps improve hearing in cases of ossicular erosion due to chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), cholesteatoma, or trauma. Types of Tympanoplasty (Wullstein's Classification): Type Description Type I Defect: perforated tympanic membrane. Repaired using a graft. (myringoplasty) (Option A ruled out) Type II Defect: Eroded malleus and perforated tympanic membrane. Graft placed on incus or remaining malleus. (Option B ruled out) Type III Defect: Absence of malleus and incus. Graft placed directly on stapes head (myringostapediopexy or columella tympanoplasty). Type IV Defect: Only the footplate of the stapes is present. It is exposed to the external ear. A graft is placed between oval and round windows, allowing sound to act directly on the footplate and the round window is shielded. (Option D ruled out) Type V Fenestration operation: Creation of a new window on the horizontal semicircular canal, covering it with a graft when the stapes footplate is fixed but the round window is functional. 246",

      "explanation": "1. Clinical Presentation: • Severe chest pain, dyspnea, distended neck veins (JVD), and hypotension (80/50 mmHg) suggest a life-threatening tension pneumothorax. • Trauma history (fight) further supports the diagnosis. 2. Increased Intrathoracic Pressure → Impaired Venous Return → Distended Neck Veins (JVD) • As intrathoracic pressure rises, it compresses the superior vena cava (SVC) and right atrium, obstructing venous return to the heart. • This results in jugular venous distension (JVD) due to backed-up blood in the venous system. 3. Decreased Preload & Cardiac Output → Hypotension (Low BP) • The compression of the right atrium and ventricle reduces blood filling (preload), decreasing stroke volume and cardiac output. • This leads to severe hypotension and, if untreated, cardiac arrest due to obstructive shock. 283 4.

Bacterial Meningitis in Adults and Prevention 292 Causes Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitides are the primary causes. Listeria monocytogenes is a significant risk in adults over 50, especially in those with diabetes, alcoholism, or weakened immune systems. Pathophysiological Process Classic Triad of Symptoms • Fever • Headache • Nuchal rigidity (stiff neck) CSF Findings • Opening pressure: Elevated • Predominant cell type: Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) • Protein: Elevated • Glucose: Decreased • Gross appearance: Turbid 293 Treatment • Immediate Management: • Start with intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover pathogens. • First-line antibiotic of choice: Ceftriaxone • Treatment is then adjusted based on the identified organism and its susceptibility • Adjunctive Therapy:Dexamethasone may be given to reduce inflammation and prevent complications, particularly if administered early. • Supportive Care: Manage complications like raised intracranial pressure and seizures. Prevention • Vaccines for H. influenzae type b, N. meningitidis, and S. pneumoniae. No vaccine currently exists for group B meningococcal infections. • Chemoprophylaxis: Close contacts of individuals with meningococcal meningitis should receive prophylactic antibiotics like rifampicin, ciprofloxacin, azithromycin or ceftriaxone to reduce the risk of secondary infections. • Rifampicin - 600 mg 12 hourly for 2 days • Ciprofloxacin - 500 mg single dose • Azithromycin 500 mg single dose • Ceftriaxone - 250 mg Intramuscular single dose Ampicillin (Option A)is primarily used in Listeria monocytogenes meningitis, which is more common in neonates, elderly, and immunocompromised patients. It is not first-line for typical bacterial meningitis in healthy adults. Penicillin (Option C)was historically used for Neisseria meningitidis but is not sufficient as monotherapy due to increasing resistance. Empirical therapy requires broader coverage. Vancomycin (Option D)is used in combination with Ceftriaxone when penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae is suspected, but it is not sufficient alone.",

Risk Factors of Congenital Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis 295 Genetic Factors • White race of northern European descent • Male sex • Familial History: Higher risk in offspring of mothers with CHPS (20% for sons, 10% for daughters) • Twin Studies: Higher concordance in monozygotic twins suggests a genetic component • Blood Groups: Infants with B and O blood groups. Environmental Factors • Erythromycin Use: Especially if administered within the first two weeks of life • Higher incidence in infants whose mothers used macrolides during pregnancy or breastfeeding, particularly in females. Other Associated Factors • Other Congenital Defects Syndromes: Occasionally associated with tracheoesophageal fistula and hypoplasia or agenesis of the inferior labial frenulum. • Associated with eosinophilic gastroenteritis, Apert syndrome, Zellweger syndrome, trisomy 18, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, and Cornelia de Lange syndrome. • Clinical Presentation: • Symptoms: Projectile, non-bilious vomiting after feeds, starting around 2 to 6 weeks of age. • Physical Examination: Visible gastric peristalsis and a palpable “olive- shaped” mass in the epigastric region. • Diagnosis: • Ultrasound (USG) is the Investigation of choice for CHPS, characterised by • Pyloric muscle thickness of > 3 mm • Pyloric length > 14 mm • The pyloric channel appears elongated and thickened (10-14 mm) 296 • Contrast Studies (Upper GI Series): Less frequently used, demonstrating the classic \"string sign\" with a thin line of contrast through the elongated and narrowed pyloric channel and delayed gastric emptying without duodenal dilation. Characteristic findings of Contrast studies in CHPS Findings Description String Sign A thin line of contrast material passes through the narrowed pyloric channel, indicating severe narrowing due to hypertrophied muscle. 297 Shoulder Sign A bulge of the hypertrophied pyloric muscle into the gastric antrum gives the appearance of a “shoulder.” Double Tract Sign Parallel streaks of contrast material within the narrowed pyloric channel suggest the presence of a narrow passage for contrast flow. 298 Mushroom sign Bulging of the hypertrophic muscle into the 1st part of the duodenum. Esophageal atresia (Option A) will have bilious vomiting and does not present with any mass in the epigastrium. Duodenal atresia (Option B)presents with bilious vomiting immediately after birth.

      "explanation": "Treatment of DVT: Anticoagulation:For initial management of acute DVT without contraindications to anticoagulation, the current recommended approach is to start with LMWH and transition to an oral anticoagulant. This approach has several advantages: • LMWH provides rapid anticoagulation without the need for monitoring. • Oral anticoagulants have shown non-inferiority or superiority to warfarin in large clinical trials. They have a better safety profile and do not require regular INR monitoring. • This regimen allows for outpatient management in many cases, reducing hospitalization rates. Investigation of DVT: 300 Venous Doppler with Duplex scanning Non-invasive; detects thrombus by impaired blood flow and inability to compress veins. • Presence of echogenic material completely filling the lumen of vein • Absence of compressibility • Absence of blood flow Venogram Accurate for detecting and locating thrombus and differentiating occlusive and non-occlusive thrombus but less commonly used due to invasiveness. Impedance Plethysmography Measures changes in venous volume and flow using a cuff. Less useful for calf DVT and previous thrombosis. Fibrin and Fibrinogen Assays Measures fibrin degradation products, including D-dimer. D-dimer has a high negative predictive value. Radioactive Fibrinogen Study Uses radiolabeled fibrinogen to detect thrombus. Less commonly used. Magnetic Resonance Venous Imaging (MRVI) Non-invasive; Useful for imaging iliac veins and IVC. Management of DVT: Initial Anticoagulation • Subcutaneous LMWH: Rapidly anticoagulate confirmed DVT cases. • Intravenous Unfractionated Heparin: For patients with significant renal impairment. • Fondaparinux or Bivalirudin: Alternatives for those with heparin sensitivity or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Transition to Oral Anticoagulation • Duration: At least 3 months or longer based on risk factors or recurrence. • Novel anticoagulants (NOACs): Rivaroxaban, Apixaban (factor Xa inhibitors), Dabigatran (direct thrombin inhibitor). • Vitamin K Antagonists: Warfarin (alternative to NOACs). 301 Monitoring Anticoagulation • Heparin: Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). • Warfarin: INR maintained between 2.0 to 3.0. For Patients with contraindications to Anticoagulation Temporary IVC Filter: Consider if bleeding risk prevents anticoagulation or to prevent pulmonary embolism. It does not treat the existing thrombus and is associated with long-term complications. (Option D) Endovascular Surgery • Thrombus removal, lysis, and stenting. • Beneficial in selected patients, especially those with iliofemoral thrombosis, to reduce risk of chronic post- thrombotic syndrome. Unfractionated heparin followed by warfarin (Option A) was the traditional approach. • But it has largely been superseded by LMWH and DOACs due to the need for hospitalization, frequent aPTT monitoring for unfractionated heparin, and long-term INR monitoring for warfarin. Catheter-directed thrombolysis(Option C) is generally reserved for massive iliofemoral DVT with severe symptoms or limb-threatening situations. • It carries a higher risk of bleeding and is not first-line therapy for most DVT cases.",

      "explanation": "Proteus antigens are classified asheterophile antigens because they cross-react with antibodies produced against Rickettsia in the diagnosis of typhus. Weil-Felix Test: • Weil-Felix Test is a heterophile agglutination test that works on the principle of rickettsial antibodies showing antigenic cross-reactivity with Proteus antigens (OX 19, OX 2 and OX K strains). • It is a tube agglutination test where serial dilutions of a patient's serum are treated with non-motile strains of P. vulgaris OX 19 and OX 2 and P. mirabilis OX K. Disease Agglutination Test Result Epidemic and endemic typhus Mainly agglutinates with OX19; sometimes with OX2 Tick-borne Spotted Fever Antibodies to both OX19 and OX2 elevated. Scrub Typhus Raised antibodies to OXK 311 Rickettsial Pox, Q Fever, Ehrlichiosis, Bartonellosis Negative test • False-positive titer - Due to underlying Proteus infection. Hence, fourfold rise of antibody titer in paired sera is better than a single high titer. • False-negative titer - Due to excess antibodies in the patient's sera (prozone phenomenon). This can be obviated by testing with serial dilutions of the patient's serum. Sequestered antigens (Option A)are normally hidden from the immune system due to anatomical barriers (e.g., myelin basic protein, lens proteins of the eye, sperm-associated antigens). When exposed after trauma, infection, or inflammation, they may trigger autoimmune reactions (e.g., sympathetic ophthalmia, multiple sclerosis). Superantigens (Option B) are highly potent immune activators that bypass normal antigen presentation by directly binding to MHC class II molecules and T-cell receptors, leading to massive cytokine release and systemic immune activation. Examples include: • Staphylococcal enterotoxins (food poisoning) • Toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST-1) • Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins (scarlet fever, toxic shock syndrome) Isoantigens (or alloantigens) (Option C) are antigens that vary among individuals of the same species, such as blood group antigens (ABO, Rh) and HLA antigens. These play a role in blood transfusion compatibility and organ transplantation but are not relevant in the diagnosis of typhus.",

      "explanation": "The clinical manifestations indicate acute appendicitis, despite the presence of Meckel's diverticulum. Lower right abdominal pain with rebound tenderness is a classic sign of acute appendicitis, and the presence of a Meckel's diverticulum does not change this presentation. While Meckel's diverticulum can cause abdominal pain, the specific location and presence of rebound tenderness strongly suggest appendicitis as the primary pathology. Perforation (Option A): While perforation of Meckel's diverticulum can occur, it typically presents with more diffuse abdominal pain and peritonitis rather than localized right lower quadrant pain. The presentation described is more consistent with appendicitis (Option A ruled out). Perforation would likely cause more widespread symptoms and signs of peritoneal irritation. 330 Intestinal obstruction(Option B): Meckel's diverticulum can cause intestinal obstruction, but this typically presents with colicky abdominal pain, vomiting, and abdominal distention rather than localized rebound tenderness (Option B ruled out). The absence of these obstruction symptoms makes this diagnosis less likely. Cholecystitis(Option D): Cholecystitis typically presents with right upper quadrant pain and tenderness, not lower right abdominal pain. The location of pain and the presence of rebound tenderness in the right lower quadrant is inconsistent with cholecystitis (Option D ruled out). Murphy's sign would be expected in cholecystitis, which is elicited in the right upper quadrant.",

Investigations for ectopic pregnancy: • Blood examination should be done as a routine for: • Haemoglobin • ABO and Rh grouping • Total white cell count and differential count • Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) • Estimation of β-hCG: The suspicious find-ings are: • Lower concentration of β-hCG compared to normal intrauterine pregnancy • Plasma concentration does not double in 48 hours like in normal pregnancy • Sonography (TVS): The diagnostic features are: • Absence of intrauterine pregnancy with a positive pregnancy test. • Fluid (echogenic) in the pouch of Douglas. • Adnexal mass clearly separated from the ovary (Blob sign). • Rarely cardiac motion may be seen in an unruptured tubal ectopic pregnancy. • Combination of quantitative β-hCG values and sonog-raphy: TVS provides visualization of a well-formed intrauterine gestational sac as early as 4–5 weeks from the last menstrual period. • The lowest level of serum β-hCG at which a gestational sac is consistently visible using TVS (discriminatory zone) is ≥ 1,500 IU/L. • So if the beta-hCG level is ≥ 1,500 and no intrauterine pregnancy is seen, an ectopic pregnancy is highly suspected. • Laparoscopy offers benefits in cases of confusion with other pelvic lesions. • Dilatation and curettage: Identification of decidua without villi structure is suggestive. 334 • Serum progesterone: A level greater than 25 ng/mL is suggestive of viable intrauterine pregnancy whereas a level less than 5 ng/mL suggests an ectopic or abnormal intrauterine pregnancy. • Laparotomy offers benefits when in doubt. Laparoscopy (Option A) is reserved for cases with significant clinical suspicion of ectopic pregnancy or instability. Methotrexate therapy (Option B) is initiated only after a confirmed diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy. Dilatation and curettage (Option D) is used when miscarriage is suspected and histological confirmation is needed.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "• Ketamine is beneficial in asthmatics as it provides analgesia and induces bronchodilation without significant hemodynamic instability. • Vecuronium is a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant that does not release histamine, making it safe for use in asthmatic patients. Anaesthesia in Asthmatics • IV Induction Agent: • Propofol: Preferred for stable patients, promotes bronchodilation. • Ketamine: Ideal for hemodynamically unstable asthmatics, promotes bronchodilation. • Muscle Relaxant: • Vecuronium, Rocuronium, Cis-atracurium: Safe for use in asthmatics, no significant histamine release. • Pancuronium: Releases low levels of histamine. • Inhalational Agent: • Sevoflurane, Isoflurane, Halothane: Ideal choices as they depress airway reflexes and relax bronchial smooth muscle. • Desflurane: This should be avoided due to airway irritation and increased airway resistance. Propofol and Succinylcholine (Option A): Succinylcholine may provoke bronchospasm. Ketamine and d-tubocurarine (Option B): d-tubocurarine releases histamine, which can trigger bronchospasm. Thiopental and Rocuronium (Option D): Thiopental has slower recovery times and can cause respiratory depression. 346",

First Degree AV Block Pathology • First-degree AV block is characterized by a prolonged PR interval (>0.20 seconds) without disruption of conduction from atria to ventricles. • The delay typically occurs in the AV node, but may also involve the atria, His bundle, or Purkinje fibers. Etiology • Commonly attributed to increased vagal tone in younger patients. • In older patients, often due to fibrotic changes in the cardiac conduction system. • Other causes include coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, electrolyte abnormalities, inflammation, infections, certain drugs, infiltrative diseases, collagen vascular diseases, and idiopathic degenerative diseases. • Lymes disease, Chagas disease, Diphtheria, Rheumatoid arthritis, Scleroderma. Clinical Features • Usually asymptomatic; patients are often unaware of the condition until discovered on an ECG. • In cases where the PR interval exceeds 0.30 seconds, symptoms may resemble \"pacemaker syndrome,\" including dyspnea, malaise, lightheadedness, and chest pain. ECG Features • Diagnosis is confirmed by a PR interval greater than 0.20 seconds on an ECG. • PR interval can be marked (>0.30 seconds) in some cases, and P waves may appear within preceding T waves. Treatment • Generally, no treatment is required; routine observation is sufficient. • Pacemaker placement may be considered for symptomatic patients with PR interval >0.30 seconds or those with coexisting heart disease. • No antiarrhythmic medications are indicated, and surveillance with routine ECGs is recommended to monitor for worsening. Second-Degree AV Block (Option A): 352 • This block features progressive lengthening of the PR interval followed by a dropped QRS complex, which is absent in this ECG as there are no dropped beats. Third-Degree AV Block (Option C): • Here, there is complete dissociation between P waves and QRS complexes. • This is absent in the ECG since P waves are consistently followed by QRS complexes. 353 Bundle Branch Block (Option D): • This condition shows a wide QRS complex with characteristic morphology. 354 • This feature is absent in the ECG, where the QRS complexes are normal in width and shape",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The clinical manifestations indicate malignant hyperthermia, a rare but life-threatening genetic disorder triggered by certain anesthetic agents, particularly succinylcholine. It is characterized by the rapid onset of hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, tachycardia, and metabolic acidosis following exposure to these triggering agents. The first-line treatment and specific antidote for malignant hyperthermia is Dantrolene sodium. It works by inhibiting calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in skeletal muscle, effectively reducing the hypermetabolic state and preventing further temperature elevation. Immediate administration of Dantrolene is crucial to prevent severe complications and mortality. Diagnosis of malignant hyperthermia • Best screening test: Creatine kinase test • Gold Standard Diagnostic test: Halothane-Caffeine Test Treatment for malignant hyperthermia 2 1. Discontinue volatile anaesthetics and succinylcholine immediately. Notify the surgeon and call for assistance. 2. Hyperventilate the patient with 100% oxygen at a fresh flow rate of at least 10 L/min. 3. Mix dantrolene sodium with sterile distilled water and administer 2.5 mg/kg intravenously as soon as possible. Repeat every 5 to 10 minutes until symptoms improve, with a maximum total dose of 10 mg/kg. 4. Administer bicarbonate to address metabolic acidosis. 5. Implement cooling measures, such as lavage, cooling blankets, and cold intravenous fluids. 6. For severe hyperkalemia, administer dextrose (25–50 g IV) along with regular insulin (10–20 units IV for adults). 7. Provide antiarrhythmic medications as necessary. 8. Monitor end-tidal CO2 levels, electrolytes, blood gases, creatine kinase, serum myoglobin, core temperature, urinary output and colour, and coagulation status. Neostigmine(Option A) is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used primarily to reverse non- depolarizing neuromuscular blockade at the end of surgery. It would treat the underlying pathophysiology of malignant hyperthermia and could potentially worsen symptoms by increasing acetylcholine at neuromuscular junctions. Neostigmine is contraindicated in this scenario as it may exacerbate the hypermetabolic crisis. Atropine(Option C) is an anticholinergic medication that blocks muscarinic receptors. It would not treat malignant hyperthermia and might actually worsen the condition by inhibiting sweating and further elevating body temperature. Additionally, it could exacerbate the tachycardia already present in this patient. Midazolam (Option D) is a benzodiazepine with sedative, anxiolytic, and amnestic properties. While it might provide some symptomatic relief through sedation, it does not address the underlying pathophysiology of malignant hyperthermia.",

The modest increase in surgical bleeding with aspirin continuation is typically manageable and outweighed by the potential cardiovascular risks of discontinuation. Stop metoprolol to increase cardiac output(Option C) would be inappropriate and potentially dangerous. Abrupt beta-blocker discontinuation perioperatively significantly increases the risk of sympathetic hyperactivity, tachycardia, hypertension, myocardial ischemia, and mortality.

Diaphragmatic Hernia: • It is a communication between the abdominal and thoracic cavities, which may or may not involve abdominal contents in the thorax. • Aetiology: Rarely traumatic, usually congenital. • Symptoms and Prognosis: Dependent on the location of the defect and associated anomalies. 10 Types of diaphragmatic hernia: • Hiatal hernia (Option C): Occurs at the esophageal hiatus. • Paraesophageal Hernia: Near the esophageal hiatus. • Morgagni Hernia (Option B): Retro-sternal, occurring in the foramen of Morgagni (2– 6% of CDH cases). • Bochdalek Hernia: Occurs in the posterolateral portion of the diaphragm; most common, accounting for 90% of congenital diaphragmatic hernias (CDH). It occurs predominantly on the left side (80-90%). Pathology and etiology: • CDH involves a diaphragmatic defect and often leads to pulmonary hypoplasia. • Pulmonary hypoplasia is due to both compression of the lungs and, in some cases, may precede the diaphragmatic defect. • Pathological features include reduced pulmonary mass, abnormal alveolar septa, thickened alveoli, and biochemical imbalances such as surfactant deficiency. Clinical Features: • Symptoms include respiratory distress, tachypnea, cyanosis, and scaphoid abdomen. • Infants may show delayed symptoms and present with vomiting or mild respiratory distress. Diagnosis: • CDH is often diagnosed prenatally via ultrasound (16-24 weeks) and fetal MRI. • Key findings: polyhydramnios, chest mass, mediastinal shift, abdominal organs in the chest, and fetal hydrops. • After birth, a chest X-ray confirms the diagnosis. Treatment: • Initial Management: o Birth in a tertiary care centre with expertise in CDH management is essential. o Immediate stabilization includes intubation, gastric decompression, and central venous and arterial access. o Goal oxygenation: preductal SpO2 ≥85%. o Gentle ventilation and permissive hypercapnia are recommended. • Ventilation Strategies: o Conventional mechanical ventilation, HFOV, and ECMO are primary methods. 11 o Permissive hypercapnia and low-pressure ventilation reduce lung injury. o Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) may be used to manage pulmonary hypertension. • Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO): o ECMO is used when conventional ventilation fails. o The duration of ECMO may be longer in CDH infants than in other conditions. • Surgical Repair: o Repair is typically done after stabilization (48 hours post-birth). o A subcostal approach is preferred, with a focus on primary repair if possible. o If primary repair is not feasible, synthetic patches (e.g., Gore-Tex) may be used. o Postoperative monitoring for complications like pulmonary hypertension, bleeding, and bowel obstruction is crucial. Novel Strategies: • Fetal lung-to-head ratio (LHR) on ultrasound is a reliable predictor of outcomes. • Fetoscopic tracheal occlusion shows promise for severe cases, but more research is needed. Traumatic diaphragmatic hernia (Option D)is not the likely diagnosis in the given scenario since there is no significant history of trauma that may indicate this diagnosis.",

Clinical Features of Cryptococcosis Respiratory System • Cryptococcus typically enters the body via inhalation and can cause pulmonary infection / pneumonitis - primary site of infection • Patients may present with cough, pleuritic chest pain, and respiratory distress. • Imaging shows a solitary pulmonary nodule • Dissemination of pulmonary infection leads to the involvement of other organs Central Nervous System Meningitis: Characterized by severe headaches, fever, altered mental status, sensory and memory loss, cranial nerve paresis and loss of vision It is the most serious type of cryptococcal infection Skin Cutaneous Cryptococcosis: Causes skin lesions, particularly in immunocompromised patients. Associated with C.neoformans var neoformans (serotype D) Other Organs Liver, spleen, and bones maybe involved in disseminated infections Diagnosis of Cryptococcosis Microscopy • India ink:Demonstrates the capsule, which appears as clear space surrounding the round budding yeast cells • Mucicarmine stain: It stains the carminophilic cell wall of C. neoformans 18 Culture • Sabouraud Dextrose Agar, forming smooth, mucoid, cream- coloured colonies. • Niger seed agar and bird seed agar: Demonstrates melanin production (brown colored colonies) due to phenol oxidase/laccase enzyme. • The ability to grow at 37°C and hydrolyse urea differentiates C. neoformans from non-pathogenic cryptococci. Antigen detection tests Demonstration of the capsular antigen by Precipitation and Latex agglutinationtest Treatment • Initial Treatment with liposomal Amphotericin B and Flucytosine • Maintenance Therapywith Fluconazole for 6-12 months, depending on immune status. • Monitoring: Regularly check CSF for fungal clearance, renal function, and electrolytes. • Management of Underlying Conditions: Optimize ART to reduce recurrence risk.",

Management • Resuscitative measures (Airway-Breathing- Circulation) • Decontamination • Gastric lavage with 1:5000 KMnO4 • Activated charcoal • Atropine sulfate (2-4 mg IV every 10-15 minutes until atropinization) • Signs of atropinization: Heart rate>80 beats/min, pupils no longer pinpoint, clear chest on auscultation with no wheeze, systolic BP>80mmHg, Dry axillae • Oximes (Pralidoxime) to decrease muscarinic and CNS symptoms • removes phosphate group • reduces atropine requirement Cause of Death Respiratory Muscle Paralysis (RMP) 21 Option Explanation Seen after atropine? Bradycardia Reversed by atropine (muscarinic blockade) Not seen Muscle weakness Nicotinic effect; not reversed by atropine Seen Diaphoresis Muscarinic effect; reversed by atropine Seen before, improves Nasal discharge Muscarinic effect; reversed by atropine Seen before, improves 22 Muscle weakness (option B): Remains because atropine does not affect nicotinic receptors at the neuromuscular junction.

      "explanation": "The physical finding of breath sounds heard only on the right side with absence on the left strongly supports this diagnosis of right endobronchial intubation (right mainstem intubation). When an endotracheal tube is advanced too far, it typically enters the right mainstem bronchus due to its more vertical orientationcompared to the left bronchus. This results in ventilation of only the right lung while the left lung collapses due to lack of ventilation. Mucus secretions obstructing the endotracheal tube(Option B) would typically cause bilateral decreased air entry or generalized poor air movement rather than unilateral findings. If the tube were completely obstructed, there would be no or diminished breath sounds on both sides. Pneumothorax on the left side due to positive pressure ventilation (Option C) could present with diminished breath sounds on the left but would typically have additional signs such as hypoxemia, hypotension, tracheal deviation toward the right, and hyperresonance to percussion on the left side. Bronchospasm (Option D) typically presents with bilateral wheezing, prolonged expiration, and increased airway pressures. It would not cause a complete absence of breath sounds on one side with normal findings on the other.",

      "explanation": "The patent ductus arteriosus, bilateral cataracts, and salt & pepper retinopathy are classical signs of congenital rubella syndrome. Congenital Rubella • Rubella (German measles) is a mild disease in infants and children but can cause congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) if contracted during pregnancy. • The risk is highest in the first trimester, especially within the first 8 weeks. Pathogenesis • Viremia is most intense from 10 to 17 days after infection. • Viral shedding is from day 10 of infection up to 2 weeks. Risk of Defects by Gestational Age • Highest in the first 12 weeks of gestation and decreases significantly thereafter, with defects being rare after 20 weeks. 33 Clinical features of congenital rubella syndrome • Hearing loss (most common) • Vision problems (cataracts, glaucoma, salt and pepperretinopathy). • Cataracts are the most common ocular abnormality associated with congenital rubella. • Heart defects (patent ductus arteriosus > pulmonary artery stenosis (right > left) > ventricular septal defect) • Low birth weight • Neurological issues (microcephaly, intellectual disabilities, encephalitis, behavioural issues) Chronicity and Complications • Chronic presence of the virus can cause ongoing damage • The risk of progressive rubella panencephalitis (PRP) years later is a rare complication. • Less common complications: Growth retardation, hepatitis, bone lesions. • Risk of diabetes and thyroid dysfunction 34 Diagnosis • Rubella IgM enzyme immunosorbent assay (detects antibodies) • Viral isolation (growing the virus from samples) • Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (detects viral RNA) Management • No specific treatment for CRS; supportive care is key • Early intervention for complications (e.g., hearing loss) is crucial Prevention • Standard with droplet precaution in hospitalized cases • Rubella vaccination RA 27/3 live attenuated vaccine (MMR or MMRV with varicella) effectively prevents rubella and CRS • MMR vaccine has a 95% efficacy after one dose and 99% after two doses • Vaccination side effects: fever, rash, joint pain Considerations for Pregnant Women • Immunoglobulin may be considered if pregnancy is not terminated, though it does not guarantee prevention of fetal infection Congenital CMV infection (Option B)is usually asymptomatic at birth. If symptomatic, these neonates present with jaundice, petechiae, hepatosplenomegaly, microcephaly, and chorioretinitis. Congenital toxoplasmosis(Option C) caused by Toxoplasma gondii often presents with the classic triad of intracranial calcifications, hydrocephalus, and chorioretinitis Congenital varicella (Option D) presents with cicatricial zigzag skin scarring in a dermatomal pattern, limb hypoplasia, microcephaly, seizures, mental retardation, chorioretinitis, microphthalmia, cataracts, etc.",

Leptospirosis: Causative Agent Leptospira interrogans (bacteria) Transmission • Zoonotic disease • Indirect: Contact with water, moist soil, or surfaces contaminated with animal urine. • Direct: Contact with urine or parturition products from infected animals. Pathogenesis Phases • Septicemic Phase: Entry through mucosa or skin, dissemination via bloodstream to organs. • Immune Phase: Antibodies develop, spirochetes disappear from blood; antigen-antibody complexes form, and renal colonization occurs. 41 Clinical Syndromes • Mild Anicteric Illness: Seen in 90% of cases, flu-like symptoms with fever, headache, conjunctival suffusion, nausea, vomiting, and myalgia. • Weil’s Disease: Severe icteric illness in 10% of cases; rapid progression, fatality rate of 5-15%. Culture Media • Ellinghausen-McCullough-Johnson-Harris (EMJH) medium is commonly used for culturing Leptospira species showing Dinger’s ring. • It is a semi-solid or liquid medium that supports the slow- growing leptospires, often requiring incubation for weeks. • Specimen Sources: Blood, urine, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples are often used, depending on the stage of infection. • Other culture media are Korthoff and Fletcher. 42 Diagnosis • Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT): Considered the gold standard for Leptospira detection, MAT measures antibodies in serum samples. • The Modified Faine’s Criteria used to aid in the diagnosis of leptospirosis, especially in endemic areas.This scoring system combines clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data to increase diagnostic accuracy. • PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction): Provides a faster diagnosis by detecting leptospira DNA in blood or urine, especially effective in the early stage. • ELISA: Used for antibody detection and is helpful for confirming infection in the later stages. Treatment Antibiotics: Early antibiotic therapy is crucial and often involves: • Doxycycline: Typically used for mild cases and prophylaxis. • Penicillin or Ampicillin: Preferred for severe cases. Brucella (Option A) causes undulant fever and hepatosplenomegaly but does not cause subconjunctival hemorrhage. The standard test is the serum agglutination test (SAT), not the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Escherichia coli (Option C) primarily causes gastrointestinal and urinary tract infections and is not associated with conjunctival hemorrhage, or a positive MAT. Staphylococcus aureus (Option D) causes skin infections, pneumonia, and endocarditis but does not cause subconjunctival hemorrhage or a positive MAT, which is specific for Leptospira.",

Aspects Description Causative agent Measles (rubeola) is a highly communicable childhood exanthematous illness caused by the measles virus, an RNA virus from the Paramyxoviridae family. Transmission Contact with droplet aerosols (through the respiratory tract or conjunctiva) Pathogenesis Primary viremia occurs, resulting in infection of the reticuloendothelial system, followed by secondary viremia, which results in systemic symptoms. Incubation period 8-12 days 60 Period of infectivity From 3 days before to 4 days after the rash onset. Clinical manifestations • Common in preschool children • Prodromal phase: Fever (before rash), rhinorrhea, conjunctival congestion and a dry hacking cough. • Koplik spots, pathognomonic for measles, appear on the 2nd or3rd day of illnessas grey-white, sand-like lesions with surrounding erythema on the buccal mucosa opposite the lower second molars. Rash The erythematous maculopapular rash in measles appears on the 4th day, starting behind the ears, along the hairline, and posterior cheeks, then spreading to the rest of the body over the next 2-3 days. Management Isolation. Symptomatic and conservative (antipyretics, maintenance of hygiene, ensuring adequate fluid and caloric intake, and humidification). Treatment of vitamin A deficiency: Age Group Treatment Under 6 months 50,000 IU once daily on D1, D2, and 4 weeks later 6 to 12 months 100,000 IU once daily on D1, D2, and 4 weeks later Over 1 year 200,000 IU once daily on D1, D2, and 4 weeks later Giving a measles vaccine and vitamin A supplement (Option B) or only a measles vaccine (Option D)is not appropriate since the child is already suffering from measles. 61 Institutional Isolation, nutritional management and vitamin A supplement (Option C): Institutional isolation is unnecessary in this case since the child does not have any general danger signs, respiratory distress or pneumonia.",

This addition reflects the growing recognition that survival extends beyond the immediate resuscitation period. The complete AHA Chain of Survival now includes: • Early recognition and activation of emergency response • Early CPR with an emphasis on chest compressions • Rapid defibrillation • Advanced life support • Post-cardiac arrest care • Recovery/rehabilitation Rapid defibrillation(Option A) is already included as the third link. Rapid defibrillation remains a critical component for improving survival in cardiac arrest, particularly for shockable rhythms like ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia. High-quality CPR (Option C) constitutes the second link. The AHA emphasizes the importance of proper chest compression depth, rate, allowing full chest recoil, and minimizing interruptions in CPR to optimize outcomes. Advanced airway management(Option D) is part of the fourth link (advanced life support) in the Chain of Survival. While airway management is an important component of resuscitation, the AHA guidelines emphasize that it should not interfere with or delay other critical interventions such as chest compressions and defibrillation. 71",

In this case, the patient does not appear to have an external motive. 72 Adaptation (Option C): Adaptation refers to a normal psychological adjustment to stress or changes in life. The patient's inability to speak suggests a conversion disorder, not a normal adaptive response. Somatic symptom disorder (Option D): This condition involves excessive distress and anxiety about physical symptoms, often leading to frequent medical visits.

Epidemiology Common in gardeners, forest workers, and manual labourers. Route of Transmission Minor trauma or thorn prick. Clinical features • Chronic infection affects cutaneous, subcutaneous, and lymphatic tissue. • Lesions form at sites of minor trauma or thorn pricks, starting as nodules. • Nodules ulcerate and necrose; infection spreads through lymphatic channels. • Lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis: Secondary ulcers on lymph nodes; lymphatics become hardened and cord-like. • Systemic dissemination: Can affect bones, joints, and meninges. Specimens Aspiration from nodules and biopsy material. 74 Diagnosis Microscopy: • KOH mounts or histopathological sections stained by methenamine silver stain show asteroid bodies (Splendore hoeppli phenomenon) • Yeast phase: Cigar-shaped cells. (Option C) Culture: Thin septate hyphae with flower-like clusters of small conidia; pear-shaped conidia in rosette-like clusters in mycelial phase. Serological tests: Helpful for extracutaneous or systemic infections. Treatment Medications: • Itraconazole • Terbinafine • Amphotericin B: For disseminated infection Cryotherapy. Coccidioides immitis (Option A) causes valley fever (coccidioidomycosis), primarily a respiratory illness, not associated with lymphatic ulcer spread.

This occurs in conditions where tissues require more oxygen, such as exercise or metabolic activity. • Factors causing a rightward shift (Bohr effect): o ↑ CO₂: Increases carbonic acid (H₂CO₃) formation, lowering pH and promoting oxygen release. o ↑ H⁺ (↓ pH): Acidic conditions reduce haemoglobin's oxygen affinity. o ↑ Temperature: Higher metabolic activity increases oxygen demand. o ↑ 2,3-BPG (DPG): Enhances O₂ unloading by stabilising the deoxygenated form of haemoglobin. 78 Bohr Effect A shift of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve to the right in response to increases in blood CO2 and H+ levels has a significant effect by enhancing the release of O2 from the blood in the tissues and enhancing oxygenation of the blood in the lungs Mechanism • Increase in CO2: CO2 diffuses from tissues into the blood, forming carbonic acid (H₂CO₃), dissociating into H+ and HCO3-. This increase in H+ lowers blood pH. • Decrease in pH: Lower pH shifts the oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve to the right, causing haemoglobin to release O2 more readily. Effects in Tissues Higher CO2 and lower pH cause haemoglobin to release O2, delivering more O2 to metabolically active tissues. Effects in Lungs Expelling CO2 in the lungs decreases blood CO2 levels and increases pH, shifting the dissociation curve to the left and allowing haemoglobin to bind O2 more readily for transport. Factors Influencing the Bohr Effect • Increased CO2 concentration • Increased blood temperature • Increased 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (BPG) concentration: BPG binds to haemoglobin, reducing its affinity for O2 and promoting O2 release.

      "explanation": "• Role of Glucagon in Starvation: o During starvation, glucagon is the primary hormone that maintains blood glucose levels. o It promotes gluconeogenesis (glucose synthesis) and glycogenolysis (breakdown of glycogen) in the liver. o Increases lipolysis in adipose tissue, providing free fatty acids for energy. • Phases of Starvation: o Early fasting (first few hours): Blood glucose is maintained by glycogenolysis. o Prolonged fasting (after 24 hours): Gluconeogenesis becomes the primary glucose source, with glucagon playing a key role. o Later starvation (after 3-5 days): Ketogenesis increases as an alternative fuel. Hormonal Changes in Starvation Hormone Effect in Starvation Glucagon Increases to stimulate gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. Insulin Decreases to reduce glucose uptake by tissues. 106 Cortisol Increases to promote protein catabolism for gluconeogenesis. Epinephrine Increases to enhance glycogen breakdown and lipolysis. Growth Hormone (GH) Increases to reduce glucose utilization and promote lipolysis. • Insulin (Option B):",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is the antidote for paracetamol (acetaminophen) poisoning and primarily works by restoring glutathione levels to prevent liver damage. 107 • Mechanism of Paracetamol Toxicity: o Paracetamol is metabolized by the liver into: ▪ Non-toxic metabolites (via sulfation & glucuronidation). ▪ A toxic metabolite, NAPQI (N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine), via CYP450. o Normally, NAPQI is detoxified by glutathione (GSH). o In overdose, glutathione is depleted, allowing NAPQI to accumulate → hepatic necrosis. • How NAC Works: o Acts as a glutathione precursor, replenishing GSH stores. o Enhances non-toxic sulfation pathway for paracetamol metabolism. o Directly binds NAPQI in high doses, reducing toxicity. Management of Paracetamol poisoning Management Aspect Details Initial Treatment • Gastric Lavage • Administer activated charcoal or cholestyramine (effective within 30 minutes of ingestion) N-acetylcysteine (NAC) Therapy • Initiate within 8 hours of ingestion; may be partially effective up to 24–36 hours post-overdose. • Administration: • IV: 140 mg/kg loading dose over 1 hour, followed by 70 mg/kg every 4 hours for 15–20 doses. Mechanism of Action • NAC acts as a sulfhydryl donor, replenishing glutathione. • Neutralizes toxic metabolites and prevents binding to cell proteins, reducing the severity of hepatic necrosis. 108 Liver Transplantation • Considered in cases of hepatic failure (jaundice, coagulopathy, confusion). • King's College Criteria is used to predict the need for a liver transplant in patients with paracetamol-induced acute liver failure: • Arterial blood pH < 7.30 Or all of the following: • Prothrombin time (PT) > 100 seconds (INR > 6.5) • Serum creatinine > 300 μmol/L • Grade III or IV hepatic encephalopathy. • Inhibits the toxin (Option A) is",

Adverse effects of ACEI: Adverse Effect Description Hypotension Decrease in blood pressure, especially upon initiation of therapy or with dosage increases. 111 Hyperkalemia Increased serum potassium levels due to reduced aldosterone secretion. Cough Persistent dry cough, possibly due to bradykinin buildup in the lungs. Angioedema Due to increased bradykinin levels, swelling of deeper layers of skin, particularly around the eyes and lips, can be life-threatening. Rashes/Urticaria Skin reactions like rashes or hives occur in a small percentage of users. Dysgeusia Reversible taste changes are more common with captopril. Rare Effects Granulocytopenia (low white blood cells) and proteinuria (excess protein in urine) are more concerning in patients with kidney disease. Acute Renal Failure Possible in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis due to decreased kidney filtration. Fetal Effects ACE inhibitors are contraindicated during pregnancy due to potential harm to the fetus, including fetal renal damage due to inhibition of the fetal renin-angiotensin system. • Methyldopa (Option A): Preferred for chronic hypertension (centrally acting α₂- agonist). • Labetalol (Option C): Used in hypertensive emergencies and preeclampsia (combined α- & β-blocker). • Nifedipine (Option D): Safe for hypertension and preeclampsia (calcium channel blocker).",

      "explanation": "• The ulcerative lesion at the inner canthus of the eye with pearly margins is highly suggestive of basal cell carcinoma (BCC). • The microscopic finding of palisading cell arrangement (tumor cells lining up in a row at the periphery) is a classic histopathological feature of BCC. Basal cell carcinoma • Aka rodent ulcer • BCC is a slow-growing, locally invasive tumor and it rarely metastasizes. • It arises from pluripotent cells within the basal layer of the epidermis or follicular structures. Clinical Features: • It presents initially small, scaly plaque • Slow progressive course of peripheral extension • Develops into nodular-ulcerative lesions, it has a thread-like margin, telangiectasia and it bleeds on touch. 162 Site: Face, Around eyes, Nose Histopathology: peripheral palisading of tumour cells (shown in the image), the cells resemble cells of stratum basale that have grown into the dermis. This cluster of cells is surrounded at the periphery by perpendicularly arranged cells. It also has a well-organized stroma surrounding it. Treatment • Medical: Imiquimod, 5-FU,Intralesional interferon α-2b • Hedgehog pathway inhibitors:(Vismodegib) • Surgical: o Mohs micrographic surgery is done in recurrent BCCs. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (Option A): SCC presents with keratin pearls, intercellular bridges, and more aggressive behavior, usually affecting the lower lip and sun-exposed areas. Keratoacanthoma (Option C): A rapidly growing, dome-shaped lesion with a central keratin plug, often resolving spontaneously. Melanocytic melanoma (OptionD): Characterized by atypical melanocytes, pagetoid spread, and high metastatic potential, often pigmented and not classically ulcerative with pearly margins.",

      "explanation": "The Double Ring Sign, also called the Halo Sign, is a bedside test used to detect CSF leakage in cases of CSF rhinorrhea or otorrhea (leakage of cerebrospinal fluid from the nose or ear). When a fluid sample (suspected to be mixed with CSF) is placed on a filter paper or gauze, it forms: 1. An inner dark red ring (blood) 2. An outer clear ring (CSF) This occurs because CSF is less dense and spreads outward, forming a halo or double ring pattern around the blood. Investigations for CSF Rhinorrhea • Handkerchief test (Halo sign) (Option C): Simple bedside test; CSF forms clear halo around blood spot. • Beta-2 transferrin (Option A): Gold standard biochemical test; highly specific for CSF. • High-Resolution CT (HRCT): Identifies bony defects in skull base. • CT Cisternography: Contrast-enhanced; precise localization of active CSF leaks. • MRI Cisternography: Non-invasive; useful for identifying meningoceles/encephaloceles. • Fluorescein Test: Intrathecal dye injection; helps in intraoperative leak localization. Other Options: The Teardrop Sign (Option D): on imaging refers to a triangular-shaped soft tissue mass often seen in orbital trauma or orbital floor fractures, indicating herniation of orbital contents. 181",

Veress Needle Feature Description Purpose Creates pneumoperitoneum for laparoscopy Mechanism Spring-loaded blunt stylet for safety Insertion Site Commonly at the umbilicus Alternative Hasson’s open technique 216 Pneumoperitoneum in Laparoscopy Aspect Details Definition Artificial creation of gas insufflation in the peritoneal cavity to facilitate laparoscopic surgery. Common Gas Used Carbon dioxide (CO₂) due to its rapid absorption, non- combustibility, and high solubility in blood. Techniques Closed technique: Uses Veress needle for insufflation. Open technique: Uses Hasson’s cannula without prior insufflation. Insufflation Pressure 10-15 mmHg (optimal for maintaining surgical space while minimizing complications). Complications Gas-related: Hypercapnia, acidosis, gas embolism. Entry-related: Bowel injury, vascular injury, preperitoneal insufflation. 217 Prevention of Complications Correct needle placement confirmation (aspiration test, saline drop test).

Methods of Urine Sample Collection: • Midstream Sample (Toilet-Trained Children): • Suitable for most toilet-trained children. • Clean the introitus before collecting the sample. • Voided Sample (Uncircumcised Males): • Prepuce must be retracted to avoid contamination. • Non-retractable prepuce can lead to unreliable, contaminated samples. • Catheterized or Suprapubic Aspiration (Children Not Toilet-Trained): • Preferred methods for children under 2 years old. • Adhesive Collection Bag: • Can be used in children not toilet-trained if the skin is disinfected. • Useful for negative urinalysis or culture; has a 99% negative predictive value. • Not recommended if immediate treatment is planned due to high contamination risk. • Suprapubic Aspirate: (Option C) 233 • Rarely needed; generally not recommended unless there are specific concerns. Contamination Concerns: • Bagged Specimen: Positive cultures can result from contamination, especially in females and uncircumcised males. • Contamination Risk: A high rate of contamination may occur, especially with mixed organisms.

Vitamin D Supplementation: • Stoss Therapy: 239 o Administer 300,000-600,000 IU of vitamin D orally or intramuscularly over 1 day (2-4 doses). o Vitamin D₃ is preferred due to its longer half-life. o Ideal for patients with questionable adherence. • Alternative Strategy: Daily Vitamin D minimum dose of 2,000 IU/day for at least 3 months. • Follow-Up: Both strategies should follow up with 400 IU/day (<1 year old) or 600 IU/day (>1 year old). 2. Calcium Supplementation: Provide oral calcium (30-75 mg/kg/day, maximum 500 mg). 3. Phosphorus Supplementation 4. Monitoring: Radiological improvement (white line of healing in the metaphyses) should be visible within 4 weeks.

Tests for Ovarian Reserve: Test Name Description Key Points 266 Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) A hormone produced by ovarian antral follicles. • Blood test reflecting the remaining quantity of eggs. • Not affected by the menstrual cycle. • The single best test for assessing her ovarian reserve Antral Follicle Count (AFC) Ultrasound count of the small follicles (antral follicles) within the ovaries. • Direct visual assessment. • Can vary with the cycle. • Baseline assessment and monitoring. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) Measures the level of FSH, which stimulates the growth of ovarian follicles. • Blood test done on day 3 of the menstrual cycle. • Initial screening of ovarian function. Estradiol (E2) Measures the level of estradiol, an estrogen produced by growing follicles. • Blood test done on day 3 of the menstrual cycle. • High levels can mask high FSH levels, so they are used in conjunction with FSH. Inhibin B Measures the level of inhibin B, which reflects the number of antral follicles. • Blood test on day 5 of the menstrual cycle. Clomiphene Citrate Challenge Test (CCCT) Measures FSH and estradiol before and after taking clomiphene citrate. • Two blood tests: day 3 and day 10. • Higher FSH levels on day 10 indicate lower reserve. • Used for detailed functional assessment. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) on day 3 (Option A): • Elevated levels of FSH on the third day of the menstrual cycle can indicate diminished ovarian reserve. • However, FSH levels can fluctuate and be influenced by various factors, making it a less reliable single test. 267 Estradiol on day 3 (Option B): • Elevated estradiol levels on the third day of the menstrual cycle can suggest a diminished ovarian reserve. • However, like FSH, estradiol levels can be variable and influenced by other factors. Serum inhibin levels on day 5 (Option D): • Inhibin B levels can reflect the size and function of the ovarian follicle pool, but they can be more variable and less consistent than AMH.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "• Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, also known as broken heart syndrome, is characterized by transient left ventricular dysfunction often triggered by emotional or physical stress. • The patient’s recent stressful event, post-menopausal status, ballooning of the left ventricle, and minimal elevation of cardiac enzymes align perfectly with this diagnosis. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (Gebrochenes-Herz syndrome) About • Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, also known as broken-heart syndrome or stress-induced cardiomyopathy, is a non-ischemic condition primarily affecting post-menopausal women. • It features temporary left ventricular dysfunction that resembles a heart attack but with minimal cardiac enzyme release and no significant obstructive coronary artery disease. • The name \"Takotsubo\" is derived from Japanese, meaning octopus trap, reflecting the ballooning shape of the left ventricle during contraction. 286 Pathophysiology • Catecholamine Hypothesis: Elevated catecholamines (norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine) indicate stress- induced sympathetic overdrive, leading to microvascular spasms and myocardial injury. • Microvascular Dysfunction: Impaired function is suggested by abnormalities in coronary flow reserve and microvascular resistance. • Inflammation: Imaging may show myocardial oedema, necrosis, and fibrosis, with conditions like myocarditis and autoimmune diseases potentially triggering TC. • Estrogen Deficiency: Exaggerated vasoconstriction and increased sympathetic activity in post-menopausal women contribute to TC. Clinical features • Takotsubo cardiomyopathy often mimics acute coronary syndrome.(MI) • Common Triggers: • Emotional Stress: Events like the unexpected death of a loved one, domestic abuse, or financial loss. • Physical Stress: Serious medical diagnoses or natural disasters. • Symptoms: Chest pain, dyspnea, and syncope. Some patients may have signs of heart failure, such as tachyarrhythmias or bradyarrhythmias. • A late-peaking systolic murmur may be present due to LVOTO. • About 10% of patients may develop cardiogenic shock. Hypertensive Heart Disease (Option A): • Caused by chronic high blood pressure, leading to left ventricular hypertrophy. • This patient's history does not indicate long-standing hypertension. Coronary Artery Disease (Option C): • Involves plaque buildup in coronary arteries, causing reduced blood flow. • The absence of obstructive disease on angiography and minimal enzyme release suggests this is unlikely. Pulmonary Embolism (Option D): • Occurs when a blood clot blocks a pulmonary artery, leading to sudden shortness of breath and chest pain. History of long term immobilization/ DVT is present. • The patient's findings indicate a cardiac issue, not a pulmonary one. 287",

      "explanation": "The patient's clinical presentation of acute distress, diaphoresis, tachycardia, and severe chest pain, along with the ECG showing saw-tooth flutter waves indicative of atrial flutter, suggests he is hemodynamically unstable. • This necessitates immediate synchronized cardioversion to restore normal sinus rhythm and stabilize his condition. Atrial Flutter Features • Atrial flutter is characterized by a large re-entry circuit, usually within the right atrium, encircling the tricuspid annulus originating from the cavotricuspid isthmus. • The atrial rate is approximately 300 beats per minute. • It is typically associated with 2:1, 3:1, or 4:1 AV block, resulting in ventricular rates of 150, 100, or 75 beats per minute. ECG Features • The ECG shows saw-tooth flutter waves, often referred to as \"F- waves.\" • With a 2:1 AV block, flutter waves may be buried in QRS complexes and T waves, making them difficult to identify. Diagnosis • Atrial flutter should be suspected in narrow-complex tachycardia at a rate of 150 beats per minute. • Carotid sinus pressure or intravenous adenosine may help reveal flutter waves by temporarily increasing the degree of AV block. 289 Manageme nt 1. Rhythm Control: • Acute Management: • Hemodynamically Unstable Patients: Synchronized cardioversion. • Stable Patients: • Electrical cardioversion (if no intracardiac thrombus). • Pharmacological cardioversion: • Antiarrhythmic drugs: • Amiodarone • Class IA: Procainamide, Quinidine, Disopyramide • Class IC: Flecainide, Propafenone • Calcium Channel Blockers: Verapamil, Diltiazem • Beta-Blockers: Metoprolol, Carvedilol, Esmolol • Long-Term Management: • Radiofrequency catheter ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus. 2. Rate Control: • First-Line Agents: • Calcium Channel Blockers (e.g., Verapamil, Diltiazem) • Beta-Blockers (e.g., Metoprolol, Carvedilol, Esmolol) • Digoxin (use cautiously due to toxicity). • Goal: Heart rate < 110 beats per minute. 3.

Treatment of Acute Exacerbation of COPD: Initial Management and Assessment: • Symptoms: Increased breathlessness, cough, sputum production; deterioration in lung function and health status. • Triggers: Usually bacterial or viral infections, or changes in air quality. • Home management: Increased bronchodilator therapy, short course of oral glucocorticoids, and possibly antibiotics. • Hospital referral indicators: • Cyanosis 291 • Peripheral oedema • Altered consciousness • Comprehensive assessment upon admission: • Level of consciousness (response to commands, ability to cough) • Signs of CO2 retention (warm peripheries, bounding pulse, flapping tremor) • Airway obstruction assessment (wheeze, prolonged expiration) • Signs of cor pulmonale (peripheral oedema, raised JVP) • Background functional status and quality of life • Precipitating causes (e.g., infection, environmental factors) Investigations: Investigation Purpose/Findings Arterial blood gases Assess severity of hypoxaemia, hypercapnia, acidaemia; guide oxygen therapy and ventilation. Chest X-ray Identify complications such as pneumonia, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion. (Option D ruled out) Management Strategies: Management Details Oxygen Therapy • Administer controlled oxygen at 24% or 28% to maintain PaO2 > 8 kPa (60 mmHg) or SaO2 > 90%. (Option A ruled out) • Regular arterial blood gas monitoring to adjust therapy. Bronchodilators • Use nebulised short-acting β2-agonists (e.g., salbutamol, terbutaline) with anticholinergics (e.g., ipratropium). • If oxygen sensitivity is a concern, use compressed air for nebulisation. Glucocorticoids • Administer oral prednisolone (30 mg for 10 days) to reduce symptoms and improve lung function.Reduces frequency and severity of exacerbations. • Consider osteoporosis prophylaxis for repeated courses. 292 Antibiotic Therapy • Indicated for increased sputum purulence, volume, or breathlessness. • Use simple regimens (aminopenicillin, tetracycline, macrolide); co-amoxiclav in areas with β-lactamase organisms. Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV) • Safe for mild to moderate respiratory acidosis; helps reduce intubation need and mortality. • Not suitable for patients unable to protect their airway. Mechanical Ventilation • Consider if there is a reversible cause, no prior respiratory failure, or if NIV has failed/contraindicated. • Decisions should involve the patient, family, and GP. Additional Therapy • Diuretics for peripheral oedema. • Limited evidence for intravenous aminophylline; consider arrhythmia risk. • Doxapram may be used short-term for low respiratory rates. Discharge and Follow-Up: • Discharge criteria: • Clinically stable on maintenance medication. • Off nebulised therapy for at least 24 hours. • PEF reaches 75% of predicted or personal best. • Post-exacerbation follow-up: • Identify and avoid trigger factors. • Provide asthma education and a written self-management plan. Begin intravenous glucocorticoids immediately (Option C) is not the first-line treatment in the acute setting; while glucocorticoids are important in managing exacerbations, nebulised bronchodilators are prioritised for immediate relief of symptoms.",

Other features may include an opening snap and signs of pulmonary congestion. Mitral stenosis: • Cause: Rheumatic fever (most common), congenital, calcific degeneration (elderly). • Pathophysiology: Narrowed mitral orifice → ↑ left atrial pressure → pulmonary venous hypertension → right heart strain. • Clinical features: Dyspnea, orthopnea, hemoptysis, atrial fibrillation. • Auscultation: Loud S1, opening snap after S2, low-pitched mid-diastolic murmur at the apex (best heard with the patient in the left lateral position). • Complications: Pulmonary hypertension, right heart failure, thromboembolism. • Treatment: Medical (diuretics, rate control for AF) or surgical (percutaneous balloon mitral valvotomy, valve replacement). 6",

      "explanation": "• The study in the question focuses on estimating how much time nursing staff spend on various activities across the day, but not by continuously timing each task from start to finish. Work Sampling is the appropriate method here because it involves taking observations at random intervals to determine the proportion of time spent on different activities. Work Sampling: • Definition: A statistical technique for determining the proportion of time spent on various activities by making observations at random intervals. • Purpose: • Assess workload distribution. • Identify major time-consuming activities. • Provide data for staffing and scheduling decisions. • Applications in Healthcare: 11 • Studying nurse-patient interaction time. • Determining how much time doctors spend in direct patient care vs. paperwork. • Evaluating efficiency in diagnostic labs. Critical Path Method (Option A): Project management technique for scheduling dependent tasks; not for estimating activity time proportions. System Analysis (Option B): Studies entire systems and processes; too broad for specific activity-time proportion studies. Time and Motion Study (Option D): Continuous observation of each step of a task; gives detailed task timings but is more intrusive and detailed than required for this study.",

These antibodies cause autoimmune destruction of the thyroid gland. Anti-TPO antibodies target the enzyme thyroid peroxidase, which is essential for thyroid hormone synthesis (oxidation and iodination of iodine, coupling of iodotyrosines). Their presence confirms autoimmune thyroid disease, especially Hashimoto’s. Other antibodies, like anti- thyroglobulin, may also be present but anti-TPO has the highest diagnostic relevance. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis: • AKA Chronic autoimmune lymphocytic thyroiditis. • Epidemiology: More common in women, especially middle-aged. • Pathogenesis: Autoantibodies (anti-TPO, anti-thyroglobulin) → chronic inflammation → fibrosis → hypothyroidism. 14 • Clinical features: Weight gain, cold intolerance, dry skin, hair thinning, constipation, menstrual irregularities. • Lab findings: High TSH, low free T4, positive anti-TPO antibodies. • Histopathology: • Diffuse lymphocytic infiltration • Formation of germinal centers • Hurthle cells (large oxyphilic epithelial cells with granular cytoplasm) replacing follicular epithelium • Atrophic thyroid follicles with dense fibrosis in late stages • Treatment: Lifelong levothyroxine replacement. • Complications: Increased risk of thyroid lymphoma.",

Rapid transfusion leads to citrate binding ionized calcium in the recipient’s blood, causing acute hypocalcemia. • Citrate toxicity is more likely when large volumes of blood are transfused rapidly, as in massive transfusion protocols. The liver normally metabolizes citrate, but in shock or hypothermia this clearance is impaired. • Clinical signs: Perioral numbness, paresthesia, muscle cramps, tetany, hypotension, and prolonged QT interval on ECG. Massive Blood Transfusion: • Definition: Replacement of blood volume exceeding patient’s total blood volume within 24 hrs (or >10 units of PRBC). • Acute complications: • Metabolic: Hypocalcemia (citrate toxicity), hypomagnesemia, hyperkalemia (from hemolysis), hypothermia, metabolic alkalosis. • Coagulopathy: Due to dilution of platelets and clotting factors. • Volume overload & ARDS. 16 • Prevention: Warm blood before transfusion, monitor electrolytes, give calcium gluconate if needed, replace platelets & FFP in balanced ratios.

Thymic abnormalities (hyperplasia or thymoma) are common in MG. In MG, antibody-mediated blockade and destruction of post-synaptic ACh receptors reduce the number of available receptors, leading to muscle weakness. Weakness worsens with activity and improves with rest (diurnal variation). The association with thymoma is due to aberrant immune activation in the thymus. Key features: Ptosis, diplopia, dysphagia, proximal muscle weakness, preserved reflexes, and response to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Myasthenia Gravis: • Epidemiology: More common in young women and older men. 18 • Pathophysiology: Autoantibodies against post-synaptic nicotinic ACh receptors at NMJ → impaired depolarization of muscle fibers. • Association: Thymic hyperplasia (65%) and thymoma (15%). • Diagnosis: Edrophonium (Tensilon) test, anti-AChR antibody assay, repetitive nerve stimulation showing decremental response. • Treatment: Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (pyridostigmine), immunosuppressants, thymectomy (if thymoma present), plasmapheresis/IVIG for crisis.

The presence of UMN signs (hypertonia) and LMN signs (fasciculations) together is characteristic. ALS affects motor neurons in the motor cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord. • UMN involvement → spasticity, hyperreflexia • LMN involvement → muscle atrophy, fasciculations, weakness. • Sensory pathways are usually preserved, helping differentiate from other neuropathies. • Onset is insidious and relentlessly progressive, leading to respiratory failure. ALS: • Epidemiology: Usually presents in middle age; more common in men. • Pathophysiology: Degeneration of corticospinal tracts (UMN) and anterior horn cells (LMN). • Clinical features: Combination of UMN + LMN signs in multiple regions, no sensory loss. • Diagnosis: Clinical (exclusion of mimics), EMG shows denervation and reinnervation. • Prognosis: Progressive; most patients die within 3–5 years from respiratory failure. • Treatment: Riluzole (glutamate inhibitor) modestly prolongs survival; supportive care is key.

It primarily affects myelinated large- diameter motor and sensory fibers (A and B fibers), leading to weakness and areflexia. A- and B-fibers are myelinated nerve fibers responsible for motor function and some sensory modalities. In GBS, autoantibodies and immune cells attack the myelin sheath, impairing conduction. This demyelination disrupts both motor signals (causing weakness) and reflex arcs (causing areflexia). 21 Guillain–Barré Syndrome: • Trigger: Often post-infectious (e.g., Campylobacter jejuni, CMV, EBV, Mycoplasma). • Pathophysiology: Autoimmune-mediated demyelination of peripheral nerves and nerve roots. • Clinical features: Symmetrical ascending weakness, areflexia, minimal sensory loss; may involve cranial nerves (bilateral facial palsy). • Complications: Respiratory muscle involvement → respiratory failure; autonomic instability. • Diagnosis: CSF shows albuminocytologic dissociation (↑ protein, normal cell count); NCS shows slowed conduction velocity. • Treatment: IVIG or plasmapheresis; avoid steroids. • Prognosis: Most recover fully, but some have residual deficits.

This is the primary mechanism for NSAID-induced gastritis and peptic ulcers. COX-1 inhibition is particularly responsible for GI side effects, as it is involved in constitutive prostaglandin synthesis for mucosal protection. NSAID-induced GI injury: • Mechanism: COX-1 inhibition → ↓ PGE₂, ↓ prostacyclin → ↓ mucus, ↓ bicarbonate, ↓ blood flow. 28 • Risk factors: High-dose/long-term NSAID use, elderly, alcohol, corticosteroids, H. pylori infection. • Prevention: Co-prescription of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or misoprostol (PGE₁ analog). • Histology: Superficial mucosal erosions with inflammatory infiltrates. • Complications: Peptic ulcers, GI bleeding, perforation.",

      "explanation": "• Cystoisospora (formerly Isospora belli) causes chronic diarrhea in immunocompromised patients like those with HIV. Its oocysts are oval/elliptical, acid- fast, and measure around 20–30 µm (commonly ~16 × 20 µm). • Cystoisospora belli infection leads to malabsorptive diarrhea, often chronic in HIV patients. Diagnosis is made via stool microscopy or modified acid-fast staining, showing large oval oocysts. The organism is transmitted via ingestion of sporulated oocysts in contaminated food or water.

Sarcoidosis, due to extra-renal production of calcitriol by activated macrophages, presents with hypercalcemia. Sarcoidosis: • Multisystem granulomatous disease of unknown etiology, characterized by non-caseating granulomas. In sarcoidosis, activated macrophages inside the granulomas express 1-α- hydroxylase, converting 25-hydroxyvitamin D into 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol). This leads to increased intestinal calcium absorption and persistent hypercalcemia. • Because the calcium level is high, the parathyroid gland decreases PTH secretion, explaining the normal or low PTH levels in such cases.

Tension Pneumothorax: • Pathophysiology: Air enters the pleural space during inspiration but cannot exit (one- way valve mechanism). This increases intrapleural pressure → lung collapse → mediastinal shift → compression of heart and opposite lung → obstructive shock. • Causes: trauma, mechanical ventilation, rib fractures, ruptured bleb. • Emergency Management: • Needle decompression (life-saving) – 2nd ICS MCL or 4th/5th ICS anterior axillary line. • Chest tube thoracostomy in the 4th/5th ICS mid-axillary line after decompression. 44",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "• The clinical presentation of miosis, anhidrosis, mild ptosis, and a persistent small pupil even in low light is suggestive of Horner syndrome. Ptosis is a result of the weakness of Müller muscle and miosis due to the unopposed action of the sphincter pupillae with resultant anisocoria. • Pancoast tumor can compress the sympathetic nerves, leading to the classic triad of symptoms seen in Horner syndrome: ptosis, miosis (constricted pupil), and ipsilateral facial anhidrosis (lack of sweating). Acquired Neurogenic Ptosis: Acquired ptosis with drooping of the upper eyelid caused by a disruption in the nerve supply to the muscles responsible for elevating the eyelid. Causes: • Third Cranial (Oculomotor) Nerve Palsy: The third nerve can be damaged by trauma, ischemia, infection, tumor, or compression, causing ptosis and diplopia.Oculomotor nerve palsy causes ptosis as it supplies the levator palpebrae superioris muscle. The ptotic eyelid can be elevated with a frontalis sling or levator aponeurosis advancement. • Horner's Syndrome: Involves a lesion in the sympathetic pathway, affecting the Müller’s muscle, leading to mild ptosis accompanied by miosis (pupil constriction) and anhidrosis (loss of sweating). • Ophthalmoplegic migraine • Multiple Sclerosis Diagnosis: • Topical apraclonidine test is now considered the test of choice. Apraclonidine is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist that also acts as a very weak alpha 1-adrenergic agonist; when topically applied in Horner’s syndrome, it causes dilation of the affected pupil and possibly lid elevation, without change to the normal pupil.",

      "explanation": "• The image of Sturm’s conoid demonstrates that parallel light rays do not converge to a single focal point, but rather form two focal lines at different distances due to unequal refractive power in different meridians of the cornea or lens. • This optical phenomenon is characteristic of astigmatism, where light rays along one meridian focus in front of the retina while rays along the perpendicular meridian focus either behind or at a different point. • Astigmatism causes blurred or distorted vision and eye strain (asthenopia), especially with prolonged near tasks. Sturm’s conoid in Astigmatism: 1. Light rays from an object pass through two principal meridians with different curvatures. 2. Each meridian has its own focal length → creates two focal lines (not a single point). 3. The area between these two focal lines is called the Sturm’s conoid. 4. The best vision is achieved at the circle of least confusion, located between the two focal lines. 88",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "• A myopic patient with flashes (photopsia), floaters, and a deep anterior chamber suggests posterior vitreous detachment with retinal tear. This allows liquefied vitreous to pass into the subretinal space, leading to rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. • Key mechanism: Myopia → long axial length → retinal thinning + lattice degeneration → predisposes to retinal breaks. These breaks allow fluid entry under retina → separation from retinal pigment epithelium. • Deep anterior chamber in this context is due to elongation of the globe and posterior shift of the lens–iris diaphragm in high myopia. Type of Retinal Detachment Clinical Features 90 Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment 1. Floaters (dark spots) due to rapid vitreous degeneration. 2. Photopsia (flashes of light) caused by retinal irritation from vitreous movements. 3. Gradual visual field loss, initially localized, progressing to total vision loss as detachment spreads. 4. Dark veil/cloud in front of the eye, particularly when detachment reaches the posterior region. 5. Sudden, painless vision loss in large, central detachment. 6. Retinal breaks may be round, horseshoe-shaped, slit-like, or large anterior dialysis. 7. Vitreous pigments (tobacco dusting or Shaffer sign) are seen in the anterior vitreous with posterior vitreous detachment. 8. Old retinal detachment shows retinal thinning, subretinal demarcation lines (high water marks), and secondary intraretinal cysts. 91 Tractional Retinal Detachment (Option C ruled out) 1. Gradual, progressive visual loss 2. Typically painless 3. No associated flashes or floaters 4. Vitreoretinal bands present 5. No retinal breaks 6. Detached area - concave and localized 7. No shifting fluid 92 Exudative Retinal Detachment (Option A ruled out) 1. Painless and sudden or gradual visual loss 2. No photopsia, holes/ tears, folds and undulations. 3. Smooth and convex with pigmentary disturbances 4. Rounded and fixed with neovascularization on the tumor summit. 5. Shifting fluid - changing the position of the detached area with gravity - hallmark feature. Central serous retinopathy (Option D): Localized serous detachment of the neurosensory retina at the macula, seen in young stressed males; presents with central vision blurring and metamorphopsia, not flashes/floaters.",

Key features of Acute Uveitis: 1. Pain, photophobia, redness (ciliary flush). 2. Decreased vision due to corneal edema and aqueous flare. 3. Irregular or sluggish pupil (posterior synechiae). 4.

Neurotrophic Ulcer: 1. Painless despite corneal epithelial defect. 2. Decreased corneal sensation and epithelial desquamation. 3. Often branching/irregular ulcer margins. 4. Causes: herpes simplex/zoster, trigeminal nerve damage (tumor, surgery), diabetes, chronic topical medication toxicity. 5. May follow procedures like Gasserian ganglion removal or blockage, often used in treating trigeminal neuralgia. 6. Poor healing tendency due to loss of corneal reflex and trophic support.",

Acanthamoeba keratitis: 1. Severe pain out of proportion to clinical findings. 2. History of contact lens wear, especially poor hygiene or water exposure. 3. Resistant to routine antibacterial therapy; requires specific anti-amoebic agents (e.g., polyhexamethylene biguanide, chlorhexidine). 109 4. Delayed diagnosis can lead to corneal perforation and vision loss. Examination Findings in Acanthamoeba Keratitis: Symptoms: • Blurred Vision: Common in corneal conditions due to the disruption of the cornea's transparent surface. • Discomfort: Significant discomfort in the affected eye. • Severe Pain: Pain is often out of proportion to clinical signs, a key clinical clue. Signs: Early Disease: • Irregular and Greyish Epithelium: Early sign indicating amoebic invasion. • Pseudodendrites: Lesions resembling herpetic keratitis • Limbitis and Stromal Infiltrates: Inflammation at the corneal-scleral junction with diffuse or focal infiltrates in the anterior stroma. • Perineural Infiltrates (Radial Keratoneuritis): Hallmark sign, radial streaks extending towards the cornea's centre, pathognomonic for Acanthamoeba keratitis. Advanced Disease: • Ring Abscess: Characteristic of advanced infection, where infiltrates form a ring-shaped abscess. • Stromal Opacification and Vascularisation: Corneal opacity and new blood vessel growth, leading to significant vision impairment. • Corneal Melting: Serious complication where corneal tissue breaks down, often at the infiltrate edges. • Scleritis: Reactive inflammation of the sclera, not a direct infection extension. Investigations and Treatment of Acanthamoeba Keratitis: Investigations: • Corneal Scraping: • The primary method for obtaining tissue for examination. • Scrape the margins and base of the lesion after applying a non-preserved topical anaesthetic. • Staining: • PAS (Periodic acid–Schiff) and Calcofluor white: Highly effective for visualizing Acanthamoeba cysts. • Gram and Giemsa stains: Less sensitive but can also demonstrate cysts. • Culture: Definitive diagnosis by culturing on non-nutrient agar with dead E. coli. • Additional Investigations: • Immunohistochemistry: Uses antibodies to detect specific Acanthamoeba antigens. 110 • PCR: Useful for detecting Acanthamoeba DNA. • In Vivo Confocal Microscopy: Provides detailed images of Acanthamoeba cysts within the cornea. • Corneal Biopsy: • Considered if other diagnostic methods are inconclusive. Treatment Modalities: • Debridement: Removal of infected epithelium to enhance topical medication penetration. • Topical Amoebicides: • PHMB (polyhexamethylene biguanide) 0.02% and Chlorhexidine 0.02%: Effective against both trophozoites and cysts. • Hexamidine: More effective than Propamidine (Brolene). • Topical Steroids: • Considered for persistent inflammation after two weeks of anti-amoebic treatment. • Caution against use if corneal thinning is present. • Pain Management: Oral NSAIDs are recommended for pain relief. • Therapeutic Keratoplasty: Required for cases resistant to medical therapy or when corneal perforation occurs.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "• After oxytocin failure in atonic postpartum hemorrhage, the next first-line mechanical measure is to tamponade the bleeding surface with a balloon catheter (e.g., Bakri balloon). • This is a quick, fertility-preserving step that allows time for stabilization and is less invasive than surgical interventions. • Stepwise approach to atonic PPH: uterotonics → mechanical tamponade → surgical vessel ligation → hysterectomy. Intrauterine balloon tamponade is often considered the first-line for managing persistent postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) due to uterine atony when initial treatments with uterotonics are ineffective. It involves placing a balloon within the uterus and inflating it to apply pressure and reduce bleeding. This method is less invasive compared to other surgical options and can effectively control bleeding in many cases. Intrauterine hemorrhage-control devices 171 Intrauterine hemorrhage-control devices are typically used for uterine atony unresponsive to medications and massage, often as a step before more invasive surgery. Contraindications: • Allergy to any device component or packing material. • Retained Products: Should not replace evacuation of retained pregnancy tissue. Intrauterine Balloon Tamponade (Option A) Types: Multiple balloon catheters used for intrauterine tamponade. Sengstaken tube. Examples: • Bakri, BT-cath, ebb complete; • Foley's catheter (can hold up to 100 ml of fluids) • Condoms Mechanism: Hydrostatic pressure applied inward to outward against uterine wall to reduce blood flow and facilitate clotting. Vacuum-Induced Tamponade Mechanism: Applies low-level intrauterine vacuum (70-90 mmHg) to evacuate blood and clot, facilitating uterine contractions. Intrauterine Packing Plain Gauze/Laparotomy Sponges: Traditional packing method; Replaced by balloon tamponade due to its effectiveness. Hemostatic Gauze: Gauze with additional hemostatic mechanisms Compressed Mini-Sponges: Novel device. Uterine or hypogastric artery embolization (Option B ruled out) Candidates Suitable for patients with persistent, slow, excessive bleeding. Hemodynamically stable and unresponsive to less invasive treatments. Procedure Performed by an interventional vascular specialist using diagnostic angiography. Gelfoam is the preferred embolizing agent (temporary occlusion: 2-6 weeks). 172 Uterine Devascularization • Progressive ligation of more proximal arteries to control uterine bleeding. • May require a hysterectomy if unsuccessful. Bilateral Uterine Artery Ligation • Ligation of the ascending branch of each uterine artery at the lateral border of the uterus. Ovarian and Uterine Artery Anastomosis Ligation • Ligation of the anastomosis between ovarian and uterine arteries on each side. Bilateral Internal Iliac Artery Ligation • Ligation of the anterior division of the internal iliac artery on one or both sides to reduce blood flow to the uterus. Uterine Compression Sutures Techniques involving sutures to compress the uterus and control bleeding. 173 B-Lynch Suture • Envelops and compresses the uterus; most common technique. • Effective for uterine atony, simple to learn, safe • May increase risk of Asherman syndrome. Hayman Technique • Uses two to four vertical compression sutures without hysterotomy. • Suitable after vaginal birth. Pereira Technique • Involves transverse and longitudinal sutures around the uterus without entering the uterine cavity. • Requires care to avoid damaging blood vessels, ureters, and fallopian tubes; manual compression before tying sutures. Cho Technique • Utilizes multiple squares or rectangles for uterine compression. Uterine Artery Embolization Minimally invasive procedure using interventional radiology to block blood flow by injecting embolic material. Hysterectomy (Option D ruled out) It is a last resort for PPH, it may be necessary in cases where other measures have failed or when there are compelling reasons to remove the uterus. Internal iliac artery ligation (Option C): Surgical vessel ligation is more invasive, technically demanding, and reserved for refractory cases when tamponade and less invasive measures fail. 174 Hysterectomy (Option D): Definitive life-saving step for uncontrolled bleeding when fertility preservation is not possible, but it is a last resort after failure of medical and conservative surgical measures.",

      "explanation": "• Variable decelerations are abrupt decreases in fetal heart rate with variable timing and shape, often “V” or “W” shaped on CTG. • They are most commonly caused by transient umbilical cord compression, leading to sudden changes in fetal circulation. Variable decelerations: 176 • Pathophysiology: Cord compression → brief fetal hypoxia → reflex vagal stimulation → transient FHR drop. • Variable decelerations differ from early decelerations (head compression) and late decelerations (placental insufficiency). • Management: Maternal position change, amnioinfusion if persistent, treat underlying cause. • Severity depends on depth, duration, and frequency of decelerations. Non-Stress Test (NST): • It is a non-invasive test used to assess fetal well-being by monitoring the fetal heart rate and its response to fetal movements. • It is typically performed in the third trimester of pregnancy. • The mother is placed in a semi-reclining position, and two belts are placed around her abdomen to measure the fetal heart rate and detect fetal movements. Indications for NST: • Post-term pregnancy. • Decreased fetal movements. • High-risk pregnancies (e.g., hypertension, diabetes). • History of previous pregnancy complications. • Suspected intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Primary parameters evaluated during an NST: 1. Baseline Fetal Heart Rate (FHR) 2. Beat-to-beat Variability: • Normal: 110-160 bpm • Bradycardia: less than 110 bpm. • Tachycardia: more than 160 bpm. • Fluctuations in the heart rate from one beat to the next. • Amplitude range of 6-25 bpm (considered normal). 3. Accelerations • Temporary increases in FHR above the baseline. • Reactive NST: • At least two accelerations in a 20-minute period. • Each acceleration should be 15 bpm above the baseline and last for at least 15 seconds (for fetuses older than 32 weeks). • Non-Reactive NST: Fewer than two accelerations in a 20-minute period. 4. Decelerations 177 Temporary drops in FHR below the baseline. • Early Decelerations: Usually benign, occurring with uterine contractions. • Variable Decelerations: Can indicate umbilical cord compression. • Late Decelerations: Concerning as they may indicate uteroplacental insufficiency. 5. Fetal Movements • The presence and frequency of fetal movements are monitored, as decreased movements can indicate distress. Interpretation: • Reactive NST: Indicative of normal fetal oxygenation and autonomic function. • Non-Reactive NST may require further testing, such as a Biophysical Profile (BPP) or Contraction Stress Test (CST).",

It is most effective for cancers with a long preclinical phase and a reliable screening test. Cervical cancer fits these criteria - it has a well-defined precancerous stage (CIN), and screening via Pap smear or HPV testing can detect lesions early, allowing for effective intervention. • Pancreatic, ovarian, and glioblastoma cancers typically lack effective population-based screening methods and have short asymptomatic phases, making secondary prevention less useful. Screening methods: • Pap smear – Cytological detection of abnormal cervical cells. • HPV DNA testing – Detects high-risk HPV strains. • Visual Inspection with Acetic Acid (VIA) – Low-cost alternative in low-resource settings. • WHO recommendation: Screen women aged 30–49 years at least once, preferably every 3–5 years. • Early treatment of CIN significantly reduces invasive cervical cancer incidence. Levels of Prevention in Cancer: 182 Level Goal Example in Cervical Cancer Primary Prevent onset HPV vaccination Secondary Early detection & prompt treatment Pap smear screening Tertiary Reduce complications & recurrence Radiotherapy, chemotherapy for invasive CA Pancreatic cancer (Option A): Usually diagnosed late due to lack of early symptoms and reliable screening tests; secondary prevention is limited.

In such cases, IUCD insertion can increase the chance of ascending infection and sepsis. • Controlled hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus are not absolute contraindications- though they may be considered for caution depending on the patient’s overall health and choice of contraceptive method. • Conditions where IUCD use poses unacceptable health risks, as per WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC) Category 4. Absolute Contraindications: • Current PID or purulent cervicitis. • Unexplained vaginal bleeding. • Known or suspected pregnancy. • Cervical or endometrial cancer. • Distorted uterine cavity (e.g., large fibroids). • Active, untreated HIV infection with high risk of opportunistic infections. Safer Alternatives in HIV: • Condoms (dual protection). • Hormonal methods (with drug–drug interaction checks). Condition Category Remarks Active HIV with AIDS symptoms 4 Absolute contraindication HIV on ART, clinically stable 2 Benefits outweigh risks Unexplained vaginal bleeding 4 Insert only after evaluation Current PID 4 Treat infection before IUCD insertion Hypertension (Option A) – Not an absolute contraindication; copper IUCDs can be used safely. Hyperlipidemia (Option B) – No restriction for IUCD use. Diabetes mellitus (Option C) – Not an absolute contraindication; copper IUCDs are generally safe unless there is severe infection risk or uncontrolled complications.",

Asbestos can be inhaled during mining, manufacturing, or use in construction materials, and the fibers lodge in the pleura, 187 causing chronic inflammation and carcinogenesis. The latency period is typically very long (20–40 years). Asbestos: Group of naturally occurring silicate minerals with heat resistance and insulating properties. • Types: Chrysotile (serpentine), amosite, crocidolite (amphiboles — more carcinogenic). • Health effects: • Asbestosis (interstitial lung fibrosis). • Lung carcinoma (Most common) • Malignant mesothelioma (pleura, peritoneum, pericardium): Most specific. • Benign pleural plaques and effusions. • Pathogenesis: Inhaled fibers → persistent pleural irritation → chronic inflammation & DNA damage → malignant transformation.

In other words, those with high BP in childhood often remain at the higher end of BP in adulthood, and those with low BP tend to stay lower - even though absolute values may change with age. • This concept is important in predicting adult disease risk from childhood measurements and emphasizes early preventive measures. Rule of halves (Option A): Refers to the observation in hypertension that only half of all hypertensives are diagnosed, half of them are treated, and half of those treated achieve control. It does not describe lifelong consistency in BP levels. Regression to the mean (Option B): This is a statistical phenomenon where extreme values tend to move closer to the average on subsequent measurements. It does not imply consistent rank ordering over time. Cohort effect (Option D): Refers to differences in health outcomes between groups born in different time periods due to shared exposures or experiences.

Cerclage placement in cervical insufficiency: Transvaginal route: • More commonly preferred than the transabdominal route due to the ease of the procedure • It is an outpatient procedure and local anaesthesia is preferred. • McDonald’s cerclage: • More commonly used than Shirodkar’s procedure • A purse-string suture with a non-absorbable suture is applied at the cervicovaginal junction. • Shirodkar’s cerclage: • The cervicovaginal junction is cut and continuous, non-absorbable sutures (using Mersilene tape) are applied at the internal os. 204 • Wurm’s stitch (or rescue stitch) is used when a woman presents with cervical dilatation and bulging fetal membranes. Transabdominal route: • It is done only when vaginal cerclage fails or severe cervical anatomical defects are present. • Performed less commonly than vaginal cerclage. • The suture is placed abdominally at the uterine isthmus • The cerclage is left until childbearing is completed and therefore cesarean delivery is required In both transvaginal and transabdominal procedures, after the placement of cerclage, the patient should be started on progesterone up to 36 weeks+6 days of gestation. 205",

Strangulated Hernia: • A strangulated hernia occurs when a portion of tissue or intestine protrudes through a weakened area in the abdominal wall and becomes trapped. • The trapped segment loses its blood supply, leading to tissue ischemia (lack of blood flow) and potential tissue death if not promptly treated. 212 Clinical Features: • Irreducibility: The hernia cannot be pushed back. • Signs of Intestinal Obstruction: Colicky pain, bilious vomiting, absence of faeces and flatus. • History: Sudden onset of pain at the hernia site, followed by generalised abdominal pain. • Physical Examination Findings: Tense, extremely tender hernia with reddish or bluish skin discolouration and no cough impulse. • Diagnosis isprimarily based on clinical examination and physical findings. Treatment: • Initial Resuscitation: • Administer intravenous (IV) fluids. • Provide IV antibiotics. • Perform nasogastric aspiration. • Insert Foley's catheter. • Surgical intervention is done only after Initial Resuscitation. Surgical management Algorithm: 213 Mesh Usage: • Synthetic mesh is contraindicated due to the increased risk of infection. • If a mesh is necessary, bioprosthetic or absorbable mesh is preferred. Acute epididymo-orchitis (Option A): Presents with scrotal pain, swelling, and erythema but is rare in this age group and usually associated with urinary tract infection; swelling is not from birth. Testicular torsion (Option B): Sudden severe scrotal pain and swelling, but not present since birth; does not involve an irreducible groin/scrotal mass.

      "explanation": "By post-operative day 6, the split-thickness skin graft is in the fibrovascular ingrowth and early maturation phase. If stiffness develops during physiotherapy, the safest approach is to perform passive extension under direct visualization to ensure that the graft is not disrupted. • This allows assessment of graft integrity and prevention of shearing forces that could cause partial or total graft loss. Surgical excision of contracture (Option A): Contracture release is indicated in long-standing, mature scars, not within the first week after grafting. Continue physiotherapy without intervention (Option C): Risk of damaging the graft if stiffness is due to early adhesion or improper graft placement; should first ensure graft safety. Remove the graft and regraft the area (Option D): Not necessary unless the graft has failed; stiffness alone at day 6 is not an indication for regrafting.",

It works by mechanically strangulating varices, leading to thrombosis and obliteration, with fewer complications than sclerotherapy. Management of Esophageal varices: • The immediate priority in managing variceal bleeding is stabilizing the patient's condition. This involves the airway, breathing, and circulation. • Establishing intravenous access with large-bore cannulae allows for rapid fluid resuscitation, ideally with blood transfusions, to restore circulatory volume and address hypotension. 217 Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) (Option B): Used as a salvage therapy when bleeding persists or recurs despite optimal endoscopic and pharmacologic management. Intravenous labetalol (Option C): Not used; nonselective beta-blockers like propranolol or nadolol are used for prophylaxis, not labetalol. Oral amoxicillin (Option D): Antibiotics (usually ceftriaxone) are given prophylactically in variceal bleeding, but amoxicillin is not the standard choice and does not control bleeding.",

HPV testing – detects high-risk human papillomavirus DNA (especially HPV 16 and 18, which cause ~70% of cervical cancers). 2. Pap smear (cytology) – examines cervical cells for precancerous or cancerous changes. HPV testing → very sensitive for detecting the cause (virus) of cervical cancer. Pap smear → detects cellular changes before they become invasive. Together, they improve detection rates and reduce the risk of missing early disease. In many countries, co-testing (HPV + Pap) is recommended every 5 years for women aged 30– 65 years if results are negative.",

      "explanation": "• The patient presents 4 days post-cholecystectomy with a localized collection in the right upper quadrant on ultrasound. The immediate priority here is diagnosis and therapeutic drainage — aspiration will relieve symptoms, confirm the nature of the fluid (bile, pus, blood), and guide further management. If the aspirated content is bile → further evaluation with MRCP or ERCP can be planned to localize and treat the leak. Aspiration is minimally invasive and avoids unnecessary re-exploration in a stable patient. Post-Cholecystectomy Collections: • Causes: Bile leak (cystic duct stump leak, accessory duct injury), intra-abdominal abscess, hematoma, seroma. • Symptoms: Fever, abdominal pain, localized tenderness, distension, jaundice (if major duct injury). • Diagnosis: • USG: Detects and localizes fluid collection. • Aspiration: Confirms content type. • MRCP: Maps biliary anatomy if a bile leak is suspected. • ERCP: Diagnostic + therapeutic (stenting, sphincterotomy). • Surgical anatomy: • Calot’s triangle boundaries → Cystic duct (medial), common hepatic duct (lateral), inferior surface of liver (superior). • Contents: Cystic artery, cystic lymph node of Lund, connective tissue. 242 • Management pathway: • USG-guided aspiration. • If bile leak → MRCP/ERCP. • Persistent leak or large duct injury → surgical repair. Re-explore laparoscopically (Option A) – Too invasive without knowing the nature of the collection. Higher antibiotics (Option B) – Won’t resolve a large collection; drainage is required. MRCP (Option C) – Useful after confirming bile in the aspirate, but here aspiration is the first step. 243",

This allows anesthesiologists to precisely gauge the degree of muscle paralysis. 3. Superficial Location: The ulnar nerve is easily accessible at the wrist, making electrode placement simple and reliable. 4.

This situation demands an immediate and decisive response to establish an airway. • Immediate Surgical Airway: In a CICV situation, an immediate surgical airway is required to oxygenate the patient and prevent hypoxic brain injury or cardiac arrest. This must be performed as quickly as possible, ideally within 3-5 minutes of declaring the CICV state. • Cricothyroidotomy: A cricothyroidotomy is the fastest and most accessible emergency surgical airway technique. It involves making a small incision through the skin and cricothyroid membrane to insert a tube directly into the trachea. Because it is performed at a superficial level and does not require complex dissection, it is the method of choice in this time-critical situation. 247",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "• A neonate with intestines protruding without any external covering is most likely gastroschisis. In gastroschisis, the bowel is directly exposed to air and amniotic fluid 252 postnatally, making it edematous, thick, and friable. If the abdominal cavity is too small to accommodate the swollen bowel without causing respiratory compromise, primary surgical closure is avoided initially. Instead, the bowel is placed in a sterile silo bag to protect it, prevent fluid loss, and allow gradual reduction of contents into the abdomen over several days, after which definitive closure is performed. This staged approach minimizes the risk of abdominal compartment syndrome and preserves bowel viability. • Another gastric defect is an Omphalocele. Gastroschisis vs Omphalocele: Feature Gastroschisis Omphalocele Defect location Right of umbilicus Through umbilicus Covering None (bare bowel) Peritoneum + amnion sac Associated anomalies Rare (~10%) Common (~60%, esp. cardiac, chromosomal) Cause Vascular disruption of the right omphalomesenteric artery Failure of midgut return & closure Bowel appearance Thick, edematous, and inflamed Normal, within sac Initial management Silo bag, staged reduction Protect sac, repair when stable Image Surgical correction (Option A) – Primary closure may cause abdominal compartment syndrome; not preferred if bowel is edematous or the abdominal cavity is small. Conservative management with higher antibiotics (Option B) – Inadequate; needs urgent protective intervention for bowel. 253 Cover with NS soaked gauze (Option D) – Temporary measure if silo unavailable, but definitive staged reduction in silo is standard.",

      "explanation": "• The child has burn shock — evidenced by hypotension, bradycardia (late sign in children), cool extremities, and low urine output. In pediatric burns, >15% BSA requires urgent IV fluid resuscitation to prevent progression to multi-organ failure. • This patient is 6 hours post-burn, meaning there is already an ongoing deficit that must be corrected promptly. Therefore, an initial bolus: 10 ml/kg of Ringer’s lactate is recommended to restore circulation before calculated maintenance fluids. • Colloids are not given early because, during the first 24 hours, capillary permeability is markedly increased → colloids leak into the interstitium → worsen edema. Colloids (e.g., albumin) are generally started after 24 hours.

Colloids in Burns: • Avoid in the first 24 hrs due to increased vascular permeability. • After 24 hrs, it may be used to maintain plasma oncotic pressure and reduce total crystalloid requirement. • Common colloids: albumin, plasma protein fraction. Give colloid bolus (Option B) – Not indicated in the first 24 hrs; will leak into tissues and worsen edema.

      "explanation": "• In this patient, in whom intubation and ventilation are not possible is known as a “cannot intubate, cannot ventilate” (CICV) scenario → this is a surgical airway emergency. • Severe maxillofacial trauma often distorts airway anatomy, making both oral and nasal intubation impossible. In CICV, the fastest and most accessible surgical airway is emergency cricothyrotomy. Although tracheostomy provides a definitive airway, it takes longer and requires a more stable patient; not suitable for immediate life- threatening hypoxia. Cricothyrotomy allows rapid oxygenation within 30–60 seconds. 256 Cricothyrotomy: • Indications: 1. CICV situations 2. Severe facial trauma 3. Upper airway obstruction 4. Massive facial burns/swelling • Landmarks: 1. Thyroid cartilage 2. Cricothyroid membrane (between thyroid & cricoid cartilage) • Procedure: 1. Palpate the cricothyroid membrane. 257 2. Make a vertical skin incision, a horizontal membrane incision. 3. Insert a tracheostomy or endotracheal tube. • Advantages: Quick, minimal equipment, bypasses upper airway obstruction. • Limitations: Should be converted to tracheostomy within 24–72 hrs to prevent subglottic stenosis. Other surgical airway options in emergencies: • Needle cricothyrotomy with jet ventilation: In children <12 years or where surgical cricothyrotomy is risky. • Tracheostomy: elective or semi-urgent, not first-line in hypoxic arrest situations. Tracheostomy (Option B) – Too time-consuming in a rapidly desaturating patient. ICD insertion (Option C) – For chest trauma/pneumothorax, not airway obstruction.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "• History of penetrating trauma, severe tracheal deviation after chest trauma strongly suggests tension pneumothorax. Tension pneumothorax is a life-threatening emergency caused by one-way air entry into the pleural space, leading to: • Increased intrathoracic pressure → collapse of the ipsilateral lung → pushes mediastinum away from affected side. • Mediastinal shift → compression of the opposite lung and major vessels • Obstructive shock → ↓ venous return, ↓ cardiac output 263 Do NOT wait for imaging like CXR or E-FAST; immediate decompression is required. Needle decompression → large-bore cannula into the 5th intercostal space (mid-axillary line), followed by ICD (chest tube) placement. Tension Pneumothorax: • Causes: Trauma (blunt/penetrating), barotrauma, mechanical ventilation, rib fractures. • Symptoms: Sudden respiratory distress, tachycardia, hypotension, unilateral absent breath sounds, hyperresonance, tracheal deviation away from the affected side, and distended neck veins. • Management: 1. Immediate needle decompression 2. Intercostal chest drain insertion for definitive management 264 Chest X-ray (Option B) – Imaging delays life-saving intervention; done after stabilizing the patient. E-FAST (Option C) – Bedside ultrasound is useful in trauma, but here the diagnosis is clinical, and urgent treatment is the priority. O₂ support at 100% (Option D) – Oxygen is supportive but will not relieve the life-threatening pressure in the pleural space.",

      "explanation": "The most appropriate management for a femoral neck fracture in a young adult is internal fixation. This method involves surgically inserting screws or a plate to stabilize the fracture while preserving the patient's natural hip joint. • Preserving the Femoral Head: Unlike older patients, young adults have a higher potential for the femoral head to heal and maintain its blood supply. Internal fixation is chosen to preserve the native femoral head and joint, which is crucial for a young, active patient. • Preventing Complications: The goal is to achieve an accurate reduction and stable fixation to promote healing and reduce the risk of complications such as avascular necrosis (AVN) and nonunion, which are more likely if the fracture is not treated correctly.",

Etiology: Common in infants, especially premature babies, due to delayed closure of the umbilical ring. Prognosis: Most close spontaneously by 2–3 years of age. Spigelian Hernia (Option B): Occurs along the semilunar line (lateral edge of the rectus abdominis muscle), not at the umbilicus. Inguinal Hernia (Option C): Presents as swelling in the groin or scrotum, not at the umbilicus. It is commonly due to a patent processus vaginalis.

A single fall from a short height is highly unlikely to cause multiple fractures in an infant. 277 • Multiple Fractures at Different Stages of Healing: The presence of both new fractures and older, healing fractures on the X-ray is a strong indicator of repeated trauma over time, not a single event. • Fracture Patterns: Certain fracture patterns are highly suggestive of abuse, such as metaphyseal corner fractures (also known as \"bucket handle\" fractures) and posterior rib fractures in an infant.",

One important site is lower esophagus, where: • Portal circulation: Left gastric vein (drains into portal vein) • Systemic circulation: Esophageal veins (drain into azygos vein → superior vena cava) Increased pressure in the left gastric vein causes dilated submucosal esophageal veins → varices. Right gastric vein (Option B): Drains the lesser curvature of the stomach. It connects to the portal vein, but not a major contributor to lower esophageal varices. Left gastroepiploic vein (Option C): Drains the greater curvature of the stomach into the splenic vein (portal system). It is not involved in esophageal portosystemic anastomosis. Right gastroepiploic vein (Option D): Drains into the superior mesenteric vein (portal system). It has no role in esophageal varices. 279",

Specifically, it branches into the deep and superficial peroneal nerves. The deep peroneal nerve innervates the tibialis anterior muscle, which is the primary muscle responsible for dorsiflexion of the foot (lifting the foot upward). • Clinical Significance: Injury to the common peroneal nerve, which is common due to its superficial location around the fibular head, results in the inability to dorsiflex the foot.

      "explanation": "The patient's presentation following a road traffic accident is highly suggestive of a fat embolism syndrome. This condition occurs when fat globules from the bone marrow are released into the bloodstream after a long bone fracture, traveling to the lungs and brain. The classic triad of symptoms includes: • Respiratory Distress: This is the most common symptom, typically occurring 24-72 hours after the trauma. The fat emboli obstruct the pulmonary capillaries, leading to hypoxia and respiratory failure. The chest X-ray often shows bilateral patchy infiltrates, mimicking acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as seen in the image provided. • Neurologic Changes: These can range from altered mental status to confusion, agitation, and even coma, as the fat emboli affect the cerebral circulation. • Petechial Rash: A characteristic, but not always present, rash of tiny red spots on the chest, neck, and axilla is a classic finding. An elevated D-dimer is a non-specific finding that can be seen in both fat embolism and pulmonary embolism, as it indicates a breakdown of a clot. However, the combination of respiratory distress and neurological changes following a long bone fracture (common in road traffic accidents) makes a fat embolism the most likely diagnosis.",

This close relationship makes it highly vulnerable to trauma during a fracture of the midshaft. • Clinical Presentation: An injury to the radial nerve typically presents with wrist drop, which is the inability to extend the wrist and fingers.

Erb’s Palsy Definition Erb-Duchenne palsy results from damage to the upper trunk of the brachial plexus (C5 and C6 nerve roots). (Option A) Mechanism of Injury Traction or stretching of the neck during childbirth (shoulder dystocia) or traumatic separation of the head and shoulder. Anatomical Structures Involved Brachial Plexus: Formed by ventral rami of C5-T1 spinal nerves Upper Trunk: Union of C5 and C6 ventral rami Erb’s Point: Located in the posterior triangle of the neck, where the upper trunk divides into anterior and posterior divisions. Clinical Presentation  Muscle Weakness/ Paralysis ○ Shoulder Abduction: Affected (supraspinatus, deltoid) ○ External Rotation: Affected (infraspinatus, teres minor) ○ Elbow Flexion: Affected (biceps brachii, brachialis) ○ Forearm Supination: Affected (biceps brachii)  Arm Position: Limp arm by the side, forearm pronated, hand inward (\"waiter’s tip\" position).  Sensory Deficits: Numbness or tingling along the lateral arm, forearm, and hand, corresponding to C5 and C6 dermatomes. 6 Associated findings  Horner's Syndrome: Involvement of T1 nerve root, indicating a more extensive injury.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "At high altitude, low oxygen levels trigger hyperventilation, leading to CO₂ loss and increased blood pH, resulting in respiratory alkalosis. Changes during Acclimatization Respiratory  At high altitudes, lower oxygen levels stimulate peripheral chemoreceptors, increasing pulmonary ventilation.  This leads to enhanced CO2 removal, causing respiratory alkalosis. (Option C)  Kidneys respond by excreting more bicarbonate to stabilize blood pH, causing a sustained increase in ventilation and supporting prolonged acclimatization. 46 Haematological  At high altitudes, lower PO2 boosts erythropoietin production, increasing red blood cell count.  This also raises 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) levels in red blood cells.  Initially, alkalosis shifts the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve to the left but increased 2,3-DPG shifts it to the right, improving oxygen release to tissues. Cardiovascular  Hypoxia activates the sympathoadrenal axis, increasing heart rate, cardiac output, and blood pressure.  Increased cardiac output leads to an increase in blood flow, and hypoxia causes vasodilation in the systemic circulation, further contributing to increased blood flow and oxygen supply to the tissues. Tissue  In acclimatization, skeletal muscles undergo several changes, including an increase in the number of capillaries and mitochondria and an increase in myoglobin content.  Further, chemicals released from the hypoxic tissues stimulate angiogenesis.",

      "explanation": " The fundamental abnormality in Alzheimer’s disease is the accumulation of two proteins (Aβ and tau) in specific brain regions in the form of plaques and tangles. Morphology of Alzheimer’s disease:  Gross: Cortical atrophy (narrowed gyri and widened sulci) is predominant in the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes.  Histology: Plaques  Deposits of Aβ peptides in the neuropil.  They are of two types: Diffuse and neuritic (senile).  Neuritic plaques contain both Aβ 40 and Aβ 42.  Diffuse plaques are predominantly made up of Aβ 42 and seen in trisomy 21 patients. 73 Tangles  Aggregates of the microtubule-binding protein tau.  Demonstrated by silver (Bielschowsky) staining.  Commonly found in cortical neurons, especially in the entorhinal cortex, and in other sites such as pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, amygdala, basal forebrain, and raphe nuclei. Hirano bodies  Intracellular eosinophilic inclusions are typically found in conditions like Alzheimer's disease and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": " In neurons, the diameter of the axon strongly influences how quickly action potentials travel.  Larger diameter → lower internal (axial) resistance to current flow.  Lower resistance allows local currents to spread more rapidly along the axon, enabling faster depolarization of adjacent segments of membrane.  This leads to a higher conduction velocity. This is particularly important in:  Myelinated fibers: Large diameter + myelin = very high speeds (e.g., motor neurons).  Unmyelinated fibres: Speed still increases with diameter, though less dramatically than in myelinated ones.",

Beriberi is caused by thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency, which is common in individuals with chronic alcoholism and diets lacking in unpolished grains.  The Aleurone layer of cereals (food grains) is a rich source of thiamine. Therefore, whole wheat flour and unpolished hand-pound rice have better nutritive value than completely polished refined foods.  When the grains are polished, the aleurone layer is usually removed. Deficiency: Dry beriberi:  CNS manifestations are more common  Pain, paresthesia and loss of reflexes  Peripheral neuritis with sensory disturbances Wet beriberi: 99  Wet beriberi is characterized by cardiovascular symptoms such as breathlessness, palpitations, and peripheral oedema.  Distended neck veins observed  High output cardiac failure Biochemical parameters:  Thiamine deficiency affects the enzyme transketolase, which is involved in the pentose phosphate pathway. ○ Measuring transketolase activity in red blood cells is a specific test for thiamine deficiency and can confirm the diagnosis. ○ Erythrocyte transketolase activity is reduced; this is the earliest manifestation seen even before clinical disturbances.  Recommended Daily Allowance of Thiamine is 1–1.5 mg/day. Treatment:  In acute thiamine deficiency with either cardiovascular or neurologic signs, 200 mg of thiamine three times daily should be given intravenously until there is no further improvement in acute symptoms; oral thiamine (10 mg/d) should subsequently be given until recovery is complete.",

Cancer Risk: ○ Increases the risk of oesophageal adenocarcinoma. ○ The majority of oesophageal adenocarcinomas are associated with Barrett's oesophagus, but not all individuals with it will develop cancer.  Recognised as red, velvety mucosa (Barrett's mucosa) extending upward from the gastroesophageal junction & alternating with pale squamous mucosa and light-brown gastric mucosa.  Subclassified as long segment (≥3 cm) or short segment (<3 cm).  Short-segment disease carries a lower cancer risk compared to long-segment disease. 108  Intestinal-type metaplasia with goblet cells replacing squamous epithelium. ○ Goblet cells are diagnostic of Barrett oesophagus and have distinct mucous vacuoles that stain blue with Alcian blue. ○ This imparts the shape of a wine goblet to the remaining cytoplasm. 109  Goblet cells are diagnostic, with pale blue mucous vacuoles resembling a wine goblet.  Non-goblet columnar cells, like gastric-type foveolar cells, may also be present.",

The most appropriate staining technique for confirming the diagnosis in this patient is by Congored stain. Investigations in amyloidosis:  The diagnosis depends on the histologic demonstration of amyloid deposits in tissues.  The most common sites biopsied are the kidney when renal manifestations are present or rectal or gingival tissues in patients suspected of having systemic amyloidosis. 114  Examination of abdominal fat aspirates stained with Congo red can also be used for the diagnosis of systemic amyloidosis.  Staining: Stains/technique Appearance Congo red  Most widely used and specific.  Light microscopy: Salmon pink/red stains.  Polarizing microscopy: Apple-green birefringence. H & E  Eosin & hematoxylin staining on light microscopy.  Amorphous, eosinophilic, extracellular substance. Thioflavin T  Fluorescent stain.  Yellow color under UV light. Electron microscopy  Non-branching fibrils of indefinite length.  Diameter: 7.5-10 nm. X-ray crystallography & infrared spectroscopy  Cross-β-pleated sheet conformation. Methyl violet Crystal violet PAS  Amyloid positive.  Abdominal fat aspiration is preferred over rectal biopsy.  In suspected cases of AL amyloidosis, serum and urine protein electrophoresis and immunoelectrophoresis should be performed.  Bone marrow aspirates in such cases often show monoclonal plasmacytosis, even in the absence of overt multiple myeloma.  Scintigraphy with radiolabeled serum amyloid P component is a rapid and specific test since it binds to the amyloid deposits and reveals their presence.  It also gives a measure of the extent of amyloidosis and can be used to follow patients undergoing treatment.  The given images below show Congo red staining in amyloidosis. 115",

Autopsy findings typically show water in the lungs and stomach, and mucoid froth at the nose and mouth is a classical sign due to mixing of water, air, and surfactant.  In wet drowning, inhaled water reaches the alveoli, causing washout of surfactant, alveolar collapse, and hypoxemia. It accounts for the majority of drowning deaths (about 90%). The frothy fluid seen at the mouth and nostrils is often copious and persistent, even after wiping. The stomach may also contain swallowed water.  Common causes include accidental submersion, suicidal drowning, and occasionally homicidal drowning. Specific signs of antemortem drowning  Fine white froth at mouth & nostrils — increases on chest compression  Overdistended (“ballooned”) lungs — heavy, edematous, exuding watery froth on section  Paltauf’s hemorrhages — subpleural bluish-red patches due to rupture of alveolar septa  Emphysema aquosum — overinflated, water-filled lungs without putrefactive gases  Diatoms in organs (bone marrow, brain) — confirms aspiration of water before death  Water in the stomach & small intestine — due to swallowing during the struggle  Washerwoman’s hands/feet — wrinkling of skin from immersion (early in both antemortem & postmortem, but more marked in prolonged immersion)  Cutis anserina (gooseflesh) — due to contraction of arrector pili muscles  Cadaveric spasm: Surest sign of antemortem drowning 132 Feature Wet drowning Dry drowning Mechanism Aspiration of water into the lungs Reflex laryngospasm → asphyxia, minimal/no water in lungs Froth Profuse, fine, persistent Minimal or absent Lungs Heavy, water-logged, edematous Normal or slightly edematous Stomach contents Water usually present Usually absent Proportion Most cases (~75–80%) Fewer cases (~10–20%) Cause of death Asphyxia + hemodilution + electrolyte disturbance Asphyxia due to laryngospasm",

The lungs (blast lung injury) and tympanic membranes (perforation) are the most commonly affected due to their air-containing structure.  Pathophysiology involves rapid compression and decompression, causing tissue disruption, hemorrhage, and edema.  Clinical manifestations may include hemoptysis, dyspnea, hypoxia (from pulmonary barotrauma), and hearing loss.  These injuries occur without physical contact with flying debris- the pressure wave alone is responsible.  High-yield point: Tympanic membrane rupture is considered a sensitive marker of exposure to a significant blast overpressure, but absence of rupture does not rule out lung injury. Classification of Blast Injuries: Type Mechanism Features Primary Injury It results from blast waves and is often internal with no external signs.  Ears: Tympanic membrane rupture or inner ear disruption.  Lungs: Alveolar-capillary membrane haemorrhage (blast lung), most common cause cause of death in survivors.  GIT: Injuries to gas-filled organs are more common in underwater blasts. 151 Secondary Injury It is resulting from shrapnel, debris & flying objects (propelled by explosion).  Penetrating trauma.

      "explanation": " The internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve pierces the thyrohyoid membrane along with the superior laryngeal artery to supply sensory innervation to the mucosa of the larynx above the vocal cords, the pharynx, and the pyriform sinus.  In cases of foreign body removal from the pyriform sinus, this nerve lies in close proximity and is at high risk of injury.  Damage results in loss of sensation in the supraglottic larynx and pyriform sinus, predisposing to aspiration because the protective cough reflex is lost.  This nerve is a branch of the vagus nerve and has no motor component - purely sensory in this region.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": " The EBSLN innervates the cricothyroid muscle, which tenses the vocal cords to produce high-pitched sounds.  Injury during thyroid surgery can cause inability to raise pitch without causing hoarseness, since vocal cord mobility is preserved.  Professional voice users (singers, actors) often notice this subtle change more than regular speakers. Unilateral SLN Palsy  Motor Loss: Cricothyroid muscle - decreased ability to tense the vocal cord.  Sensory Loss: Above the vocal cord on the affected side.  Vocal Cord Position: The affected vocal cord appears shortened and wavy; may exhibit flapping due to loss of tension.  Other Features: ○ Askew position of the glottis with the anterior commissure rotated towards the healthy side. 157 ○ Voice changes such as weakness and inability to raise pitch, affecting singing ability.  Treatment: Primarily voice therapy to improve vocal function and manage symptoms. Bilateral SLN Palsy  Motor Loss: Both cricothyroid muscles - bilateral loss of vocal cord tension.  Sensory Loss: Above the vocal cords bilaterally.  Vocal Cord Position: Both vocal cords may be shortened and lack tension, potentially leading to difficulties with voice production.  Other Features: ○ Inhalation of food and secretions resulting in coughing and choking. ○ The voice is weak and husky.  Treatment: ○ Tracheostomy with a cuffed tube and esophageal feeding tube, if aspiration is severe. ○ Epiglottopexy (reversible) - close laryngeal inlet - to protect the lungs from aspiration. ○ Voice pitch improvement through surgical approximation of the thyroid and cricoid cartilages.

The periorbital ecchymosis and lack of facial flattening point toward an isolated orbital blowout fracture rather than zygomatic or nasal bone injury. Orbital floor fracture (also known as blow-out fracture): 164  A blow-out fracture usually occurs due to a sudden rise in orbital pressure from an impacting object, like a fist or tennis ball, causing the eyeball to be displaced and transmit, rather than absorb, the impact. Classification:  Pure blow-out fractures are isolated to the orbital walls (floor or medial wall) without involving the orbital rim.  Impure blow-out fractures involve the orbital walls, the orbital rim, and surrounding facial bones. Clinical features:  Periorbital oedema and blood extravasation in and around the orbit (such as subconjunctival ecchymosis)  Emphysema (subcutaneous) of the eyelids  Paraesthesia and anaesthesia in the distribution of infraorbital nerve (lower lid, cheek, side of nose, upper lip, and upper teeth).  Ipsilateral epistaxis (bleeding from maxillary sinus)  Proptosis (orbital oedema and haemorrhage).  Enophthalmos and mechanical ptosis  Diplopia (oedema, haemorrhage, entrapment of muscle (inferior rectus/inferior oblique) at the fracture site.  Hess chart testing (map eye movements for assessment and monitoring). Orbital imaging:  X-rays: A nose-chin (Water's) view showing 'hanging drop' opacity of the superior maxillary antrum from orbital contents herniating through the floor. 165 Plain X-ray orbit (AP view) showing herniated orbital contents (arrow) with blow-out fracture of the orbital floor  Computerised tomography (CT) scanning and magnetic resonance imaging(MRI): Evaluate the extent of the fracture and herniation of contents into maxillary antrum (hanging drop or tear drop sign). 166 CT scan of coronal section of orbit showing fracture floor with herniation of orbital contents Management:  Antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs  Ice packs and nasal decongestants  Surgery (dislodge the muscle and do microplating) ○ Indications for surgery: ■ No improvement in diplopia or enophthalmos even after 10 days (indicates muscle entrapment). ■ Enopthalmos is > 2mm ■ Half of the floor is fractured",

This aggressive fungal infection, usually caused by Rhizopus species, invades blood vessels, causing tissue necrosis and rapid spread to orbit and brain. Rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis  Fulminant, angioinvasive fungal infection affecting immunocompromised patients, especially diabetics in ketoacidosis.  Causative organisms: Rhizopus, Mucor, Lichtheimia species.  Mechanism: Fungal spores → nasal mucosa → blood vessel invasion → thrombosis & tissue necrosis → spread to orbit/brain.  Key Features: ○ Facial pain, swelling, nasal congestion. ○ Black eschar on nasal mucosa or palate. ○ Ophthalmoplegia, vision loss if orbital spread occurs. ○ Altered sensorium in advanced cases.  Imaging clue: CT/MRI - sinus opacification, bone destruction, orbital involvement  Management: Urgent surgical debridement + high-dose IV liposomal amphotericin B + strict glycemic control.  Prognosis: High mortality; early diagnosis improves outcomes. 172 173 Mucormycosis 174 It is an invasive disease caused by zygomycetes (phycomycetes) - Rhizopus, Mucor and Absidia. Rhizopus Arrhizus is the most common pathogen Rhizopus 175 176 Pathogenesis Begins in the respiratory tract or nasal cavity, where spores germinate and form mycelia → invade adjacent tissues, leading to local destruction. Fungi invade blood vessels, causing thrombosis and infarction in affected areas, which contributes to its high mortality rate (Angio-invasiveness) Common Sites  Rhinocerebral Form: Involves the nose, nasal sinuses, and orbit; frequently seen in diabetic patients.  Pulmonary Infections: When the lungs are the primary site, the fungi can invade lung arteries, leading to serious complications.  Others: Cutaneous mucormycosis, GI mucormycosis, Disseminated mucormycosis 177 Clinical Features  Rhinocerebral Zygomycosis: ○ Facial swelling, nasal discharge (often black), fever, and mucosal necrosis. ○ Rapid progression can lead to severe complications, including visual loss and neurological symptoms.  Pulmonary Zygomycosis: ○ Symptoms may include cough, fever, and hemoptysis 178 Diagnosis Histological Examination: Diagnosis is confirmed by identifying broad, non-septate (or sparsely septate) hyphae. Culture:  After incubation for 3-4 days on Sabouraud agar at 30-37°C, the colonies are grey-white with a thick cottony, fluffy surface.  Under the microscope, nonseptate, broad hyphae with aerial sporangiophores which end in a sporangium (a sac containing spores are seen.) a. 179 b. a.

      "explanation": " The diagnosis is Oral candidiasis/ Moniliasis, indicated by the presence of white patches in the oral cavity and the patient's risk factor such as diabetes. It is caused by Candida albicans, which is cultured on SDA agar. Investigations for Candida albicans:  KOH: This shows budding yeast cells with pseudohyphae  Fungal culture: It shows a creamy white colony.  Germ Tube Test is a screening test that is used to differentiate Candida Albicans from other yeast. When Candida is grown in human or sheep serum at 37°C for 3 hours, they form a germ tube, which can be detected with a wet KOH films as filamentous outgrowth extending from yeast cells. 190 Germ Tube Test Culture KOH Mount Oral candidiasis Oral candidiasis, commonly known as thrush, is an infection caused by an overgrowth of Candida albicans, a type of yeast. Presentation Presence of white patches that can be scraped off leaving behind a red, inflamed base 191 Risk factors  Diabetes: Poorly controlled diabetes creates a favorable environment for Candida growth due to elevated blood sugar levels.  Neutropenia  Immunosuppression: HIV/AIDS, cancer, or immunosuppressive medications increase susceptibility.  Use of inhaled corticosteroids  Antibiotic Use: Broad-spectrum antibiotics can disrupt normal oral flora, allowing Candida to overgrow.  Poor Oral Hygiene: Leads to an increase in fungal colonisation.  Dry Mouth: Conditions that lead to reduced saliva production can promote candidiasis. Treatment  Antifungal medications, such as nystatin or fluconazole, along with addressing any underlying risk factors.

      "explanation": " Aedes albopictus, also known as the Asian tiger mosquito, is one of the primary vectors responsible for transmitting the Zika virus. This mosquito species, along with Aedes aegypti, plays a major role in the spread of Zika, as well as other viral infections like dengue and chikungunya. Zika virus:  Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arbovirus from the Flaviviridae family, characterized by its single-stranded RNA. Transmission:  ZIKV is primarily transmitted by the Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquito.  Other transmission modes include mother-to-child (especially in the first trimester), and rarely through sexual contact, blood transfusion, and organ transplantation. 193 The life cycle of Zika virus Clinical Manifestations:  Incubation: A few days to 1 week; >80% of infections are asymptomatic.  Zika Fever: Symptoms include mild fever, rash, and conjunctivitis.  Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS): Characterized by microcephaly and neurological issues.  Neurological Complications: Rarely includes Guillain-Barré syndrome, neuropathy, and myelitis. Laboratory Diagnosis:  Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT): RT-PCR is the preferred method, detecting ZIKV RNA in blood and urine up to 7 days after symptom onset.  IgM Antibody Detection: Appears after 1 week of symptoms and can remain positive for several months; may cross-react with dengue antibodies.  Enzyme Immunoassays (EIAs) and Immunofluorescence Assays (IFA): Used if symptoms last ≥ 7 days, utilizing viral lysate or recombinant proteins. Options A, C, and D are",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": " The very short incubation period (1–6 hours) after food ingestion, combined with the absence of fever and the involvement of dairy/salad-type foods, points strongly to preformed, heat-stable enterotoxins of Staphylococcus aureus.  S. aureus produces enterotoxins (types A, B, C, D, E) that are resistant to heat and gastric enzymes, leading to sudden-onset nausea, vomiting, and sometimes diarrhea.  Because illness is due to ingestion of toxin (not bacterial multiplication in the body), symptoms appear rapidly and resolve within 24–48 hours. Clostridium perfringens (Option A): Causes a toxin-mediated diarrheal illness but incubation is longer (usually 8–16 h) and linked to reheated meat/gravies. Salmonella enterica (Option B): Typically causes invasive gastroenteritis with longer incubation (6–72 h) and fever. Bacillus cereus (Option D): Has two syndromes - emetic form (short incubation 1–5 h, often linked to chinese food) and diarrheal form (longer).",

Specifically, CCR5 is found on the 197 surface of CD4+ T cells and other immune cells, and HIV binds to it along with CD4 (another receptor) in order to gain entry into the host cell. Modes of Transmission of HIV  Sexual Transmission: ○ Most common (75% of cases). ○ Heterosexual Route: Male to female via vaginal intercourse is typical; risk per encounter is low (0.1–1%). Higher risk with anal intercourse.  Blood Transfusion: Least common (5% of cases) but has a high transmission risk (90–95%).  Percutaneous/Mucosal Transmission: Includes needle stick injuries and sharing razors; less effective compared to sexual transmission.  Perinatal Transmission: 20–40% risk of mother-to-fetus transmission without intervention; highest risk during delivery.  Casual Contact: No evidence of transmission through casual contact, kissing, or insect bites.  Viral Load: Highest in blood, genital secretions, and cerebrospinal fluid; minimal in saliva and other body fluids.  Saliva: Contains substances that may inhibit HIV transmission. Pathogenesis:  Receptor Attachment ○ Main Receptor: ■ HIV binds its gp120 to the CD4 receptor on host cells, primarily expressed on helper T cells and other cells like monocytes and macrophages. ○ Co-Receptors: Fusion requires a second receptor: ■ CXCR4: Found on T lymphocytes. ■ CCR5: Present on macrophage lineage cells. (Option B) ○ DC-SIGN: ■ A dendritic cell-specific receptor that binds HIV-1 but does not mediate entry; facilitates transport to lymphoid organs. ○ CCR5 Delta 32 Mutation: ■ Mutation can block HIV entry: 1.

      "explanation": " The given image is of E. histolytica trophozoites.  Entamoeba histolytica is the causative organism of amoebic dysentery, which can present with symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and sometimes bloody stools. In the case of a child presenting with lower abdominal pain and diarrhea, Entamoeba histolytica should be strongly considered, especially when stool examination reveals characteristic trophozoites or cysts under the microscope. These trophozoites often have a distinctive central nucleus and can cause tissue destruction in the colon, leading to ulcerations and diarrhea.

Giardia trophozoites would also look different under the microscope, with a characteristic \"pear-shaped\" appearance and two nuclei. Shigella dysenteriae (Option B): Shigella causes bacillary dysentery, which typically presents with bloody diarrhea and severe abdominal cramping. However, the stool exam would usually show bacilli or a lack of cysts or amoeboid cells, which would be different from what is seen with Entamoeba histolytica. Campylobacter jejuni (Option D): Campylobacter infection is another cause of diarrhea, and it is commonly associated with watery or bloody diarrhea and fever. However, it typically presents with curved rods on a stool culture, and the stool examination findings in this case would not show the characteristic cysts or trophozoites seen with Entamoeba histolytica.",

This condition is often associated with eustachian tube dysfunction, which can result from various underlying issues.  The most common cause of eustachian tube dysfunction in children is adenoid hyperplasia. Enlarged adenoids can obstruct the eustachian tubes, impairing the drainage of fluid from the middle ear and leading to fluid accumulation behind the tympanic membrane. Serous Otitis Media (Glue Ear)  Serous Otitis Media (SOM) is a condition characterized by the accumulation of non-purulent, often thick effusion in the middle ear, commonly affecting school-aged children. 221 Pathogenesis:  The Eustachian tube fails to aerate and drain fluid from the middle ear.  Increased Secretory Activity of Middle Ear Mucosa. Aetiology: Malfunctioning of Eustachian tube Allergy Unresolved otitis media Viral infections  Adenoid hyperplasia.  Chronic rhinitis and sinusitis.  Chronic tonsillitis: Enlarged tonsils obstruct the soft palate and affect Eustachian tube function.  Nasophary ngeal tumours: Benign or malignant, especially in adults with unilateral serous otitis media.  Palatal defects: e.g., cleft palate, palatal paralysis.  Down's syndrome. Seasonal or perennial allergies obstruct the Eustachian tube and increase middle ear mucosal secretions. Inadequate antibiotic therapy can lead to persistent, low-grade infection, stimulating more mucous production and increasing goblet cells. Adenoviruses and rhinoviruses can invade the middle ear mucosa, leading to increased secretory activity.",

Asbestos fibres are commonly encountered in:  Shipbuilding  Construction  Cement manufacturing  Insulation materials 223 Chronic inhalation of asbestos fibres → fibres lodge in pleura → chronic inflammation & fibrosis → mutations → mesothelioma (and also increased risk of bronchogenic carcinoma, especially in smokers).  Asbestos exposure is a well-established risk factor for developing laryngeal, ovarian, colon, lung, and pleural cancers.  Asbestos-related lung carcinoma is markedly magnified by smoking. Thus, asbestos workers (particularly those who smoke) are at much higher risk of dying of lung carcinoma than mesothelioma.  Compared to other occupational lung diseases, which affect the upper lobes of the lungs, it commonly affects the lower lobes.  Adenocarcinoma (primary bronchogenic carcinoma) is the most common type of cancer, accounting for about 45%, followed by squamous cell carcinoma.  Lung mesothelioma is a more specific tumour associated with asbestos exposure but is less prevalent than Adenocarcinoma. 224",

They are often seen in young women and can contain a variety of tissue types, such as hair, teeth, and muscle, which reflects their origin from all three germ layers. Mature teratoma  Mature teratomas, or dermoid cysts, are common benign ovarian tumours found in young women. They are bilateral in 10-15% of cases.  They contain tissues from all three germ layers, including skin, hair, and teeth, and can rarely undergo malignant transformationto squamous cell carcinoma.  Grossly, they are unilocularcysts with a thin wall and hair; microscopically, they have stratified squamous epithelium and sebaceous glands. Immature teratoma: (Option B)  Bulky, solid ovarian tumours that contain immature neuroepithelium, cartilage, bone, and muscle, with areas of necrosis and haemorrhage.  They grow rapidly, often spreading beyond the ovary.  They are seen in young females and have a high risk of malignancy.  They have small, round blue cells (Immature neural components). Monodermal teratoma:  Monodermal teratomas consist predominantly of a single type of tissue, such as thyroid tissue in struma ovarii or neuroendocrine cells in carcinoid tumours. They lack immature or embryonic-like tissues and typically do not have a high risk of malignancy. 229 Serous cystadenoma (Option A):  It is the most common ovarian epithelial tumor, usually seen in older women. It is unilocular, bilateral in >50% and is mostly malignant. The characteristic histologic feature is the presence of psamomma bodies (seen in 40-45%) which is composed of concentric rings of lamellar calcifications. Endometrioma (Option D): “chocolate cyst” of endometriosis, filled with old blood, not sebaceous material or calcified teeth.",

      "explanation": " 95% ethanol is the fixative used in a conventional pap smear. Fixatives are chemicals that preserve biological tissues by stabilizing cellular structures and preventing decay or degradation. The goal is to maintain the tissue in a life-like state as much as possible for microscopic examination.  Fixation helps maintain the tissue's integrity by preventing autolysis (self-digestion) and putrefaction (bacterial decay).  Crosslinking Fixatives: These fixatives work by forming covalent bonds between the proteins and other cellular structures, effectively \"locking\" them in place. This preserves the tissue’s structural integrity. ○ Formaldehyde: Most commonly used in the form of 10% neutral-buffered formalin. (Option D) ○ Glutaraldehyde: Often used for electron microscopy due to its ability to preserve fine cellular structures. ○ Osmium tetroxide: Used primarily for electron microscopy, particularly for preserving lipids and membranes.  Precipitating Fixatives: These work by precipitating proteins and other cellular components, which makes them less soluble and helps preserve their structure. ○ Methanol ○ Ethanol 236  Additive Fixatives: They chemically bind to tissue components, such as proteins or nucleic acids, and stabilise them. They are typically more gentle and produce better preservation of ultrastructure. ○ Formaldehyde (Option A) ○ Glutaraldehyde  Non-Additive Fixatives: ○ Alcohol ○ Acetone Pap smear Site  The transformation zone of the cervix, where the squamous epithelium (ectocervix) and columnar epithelium (endocervix) meet.  This is the most common site for cervical cancer to develop. Instruments  Ayre spatula collects cells from the ectocervix  Cervical broom (also called a cytobrush) from the transition zone  Endocervical brush from the endocervix Procedure  Conventional Pap smear: Cells are collected with a spatula or brush, smeared onto a slide, and immediately fixed with a spray fixative or by immersing in 95% ethanol with/without ether  Liquid-based cytology: Cells are collected and then rinsed into a liquid fixative vial. This is considered more sensitive than the conventional Pap smear as it provides a more uniform distribution of cells.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Down syndrome is caused by trisomy 21 and is the most common chromosomal cause of intellectual disability. Down's syndrome, caused by trisomy 21, is associated with multiple systemic manifestations due to the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21.  This is due to meiotic nondisjunction in either maternal or paternal gamete.  Occurs at a frequency of 1:800 to 1:1000 newborns. The overexpression of genes located on chromosome 21 contributes to the clinical features. Clinical Features and Diagnosis: General Features:  Intellectual disability  Flat facial profile, upward-slanting eyes with epicanthic folds, oblique palpebral fissure (visible when eyes are open).  Small nose with flat nasal bridge  Narrow palate, small teeth, and furrowed, protruding tongue  Significant hypotonia  Small, brachycephalic skull with flat occiput, and small, dysplastic ears  Short, broad hands with clinodactyly (hypoplasia of the middle phalanx of the fifth finger)  Simian crease on the palm  A wide gap between the first and second toes (sandal gap) Comorbidities  Congenital Heart Disease:: 40% of children have congenital heart defects, primarily endocardial cushion defects (40-60% of cases) - AVSD, VSD, ASD, PDA, TOF. Early cardiac evaluation is crucial.  Gastrointestinal Malformations: 12% have atresias, especially duodenal atresia. There is an increased risk of annular pancreas and Hirschsprung disease.  Ophthalmic Problems: Increased risk of cataracts, nystagmus, strabismus, and visual acuity issues. Regular eye evaluations are advised from infancy onward.  Hearing Defects: 40-60% experience conductive hearing loss, often due to serous otitis media in the first year. Routine hearing assessments are recommended before 6 months of age and annually.  Thyroid Dysfunction: Hypothyroidism occurs in 13-54% of patients. 242  Atlanto-occipital Subluxation: Incidence ranges from 10-30%. A lateral neck radiograph is recommended.  Physical Growth: Linear growth is typically slower, and children may become obese with age. Muscle tone often improves, but regular monitoring of height and weight is necessary.  Malignancies: Increased risk of lymphoproliferative disorders, such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplasia, and transient lymphoproliferative syndrome.  Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease: The APP gene, located on chromosome 21, plays a significant role in amyloid plaque formation, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease.",

This protects cells from oxidative damage. SOD1 and ALS:  Condition: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease.  Type: SOD1 mutations account for about 20% of familial ALS cases (familial ALS ~10% of all ALS cases).  Mechanism: ○ Mutant SOD1 misfolds → gains toxic properties → causes oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. ○ This leads to degeneration of both upper motor neurons (in motor cortex) and lower motor neurons (in brainstem and spinal cord). Clinical Features of ALS:  Mixed UMN and LMN signs: ○ UMN: Spasticity, hyperreflexia, Babinski sign. ○ LMN: Fasciculations, muscle atrophy, weakness.  Progressive, usually fatal within 3–5 years (respiratory failure common).  Sensation and cognition are usually preserved (helps differentiate from MS or other neuropathies). Huntington’s disease (Option A): CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the HTT gene (chromosome 4). Multiple sclerosis (Option B): Autoimmune demyelination, not linked to SOD1.

      "explanation": " Diabetic patient with seizures → raises suspicion for a brain lesion (possibly abscess, infarct, or infection-related pathology).  Histopathology: liquefactive necrosis → classic type of necrosis seen in brain tissue.  Liquefactive necrosis in brain is mainly due to hydrolytic enzyme action breaking down tissue.  In the CNS, ischemia or infection activates microglia and infiltrating neutrophils.  These cells release lysosomal hydrolytic enzymes.  Brain tissue is rich in lipids and has little structural stroma, so enzymatic digestion quickly converts tissue into a liquid mass.  Mechanism: enzymatic degradation > structural breakdown → liquefactive necrosis. Mechanical (Option B): Trauma can cause hemorrhage or contusion, but necrosis type is not primarily from mechanical injury alone, here histology points to enzymatic breakdown. Ischemic (Option C): Ischemia in most organs causes coagulative necrosis, except in the brain, where it still leads to liquefactive necrosis, but the mechanism is enzymatic digestion, not ischemia per se. Pressure (Option D): Increased intracranial pressure can cause herniation or atrophy, not liquefactive necrosis by itself. 251",

Severe pneumonia: Cough or difficulty breathing plus any danger sign (e.g., chest indrawing with general danger signs such as inability to feed, lethargy, convulsions, hypoxia). Classification Signs Treatment Severe Pneumonia or Very Severe Disease Any general danger sign OR  Oxygen saturation <90%  Stridor in calm child  Central cyanosis  Convulsions  AVPU = V, P, or U  Start oxygen therapy if saturation < 90%.  Administer Benzyl Penicillin & Gentamicin.  Give diazepam if convulsing.  Prevent low blood sugar.  Treat wheeze if present.  Urgent referral or admission. Pneumonia Chest indrawing in calm child OR Fast breathing AND No signs of severe pneumonia  Administer Amoxicillin Dispersible Tablet.  Give Vitamin A.  Treat wheeze if present.  Follow up in 5 days  Advise on immediate return signs. No Pneumonia: Cough or Cold No signs of pneumonia or very severe disease  Treat wheeze if present - salbutamol for 5 days  Advise on immediate return signs. 261 In this case:  Age = 4 months (threshold for tachypnea ≥50/min; child has 66/min).  Signs = Chest indrawing, nasal flaring, but no danger signs like inability to feed, cyanosis, altered consciousness. ○ Fits pneumonia classification, not severe pneumonia.",

Therefore, the most logical next step is testing the local water supply for fluoride concentration. Endemic fluorosis:  Caused by long-term ingestion of water with fluoride >1.5 mg/L.  Early signs: joint stiffness, dental fluorosis.  Late signs: bony overgrowths, deformities, restricted movements.  Prevention: defluoridation of water, alternative safe water sources. 270 Check serum vitamin D levels (Option A): Could detect rickets/osteomalacia, but wouldn’t explain a cluster in the same area.

They are kept under proper cold chain conditions (2–8 °C). Pentavalent vaccine → liquid formulation with preservative → can be reused until expiry within the 28-day rule. 275 MR (Measles-Rubella) vaccine → lyophilized (freeze-dried) powder without preservative, reconstituted with diluent before use → must be discarded within 4 hours of reconstitution, irrespective of remaining doses. Open Vial Policy:  Allows certain vaccines to be used in multiple immunization sessions after opening the vial, if stored and handled properly. If the vaccine is under the open vial policy then VVM will bw on the body (not on cap/neck). Purpose:  Reduce vaccine wastage  Ensure uninterrupted immunization services  Lower programme costs without compromising safety. The vaccine can be kept and used for up to 28 days after opening only if:  Vaccine is WHO-prequalified for MDVP use  Vaccine vial is kept at recommended storage temperature (+2°C to +8°C)  VVM (Vaccine Vial Monitor) has not crossed discard point  Expiry date has not passed  Aseptic technique used every time vial is opened  Reconstituted vaccines (like BCG, Measles, MR, JE) must be discarded within 6 hours or at the end of the session — no exception. Vaccines NOT under Open Vial Policy:  BCG  Measles / MR  COVID 19 (use within 8 hours) Discard Pentavalent, reuse MR (Option B): Wrong - MR cannot be used after 4 hous of reconstitution, so it must be discarded.

Family life cycle: Sequence of changes a family undergoes over time. The main stages are: 282 1. Formation: Creation of a new family unit (usually marriage or cohabitation). 2. Extension: Addition of new members (e.g., birth of a child) without losing existing members. 3. Complete Extension: Addition of members from multiple generations (e.g., grandparents moving in + birth of grandchildren). 4. Contraction: Loss of members (e.g., children leaving home, death of elderly) without replacement. 5. Complete Contraction: Loss of members leaving only one or two people in the family unit. 6. Dissolution: The family unit breaks due to the death of one spouse (widow/widower remains). 7. Extinction: Death of the last surviving family member. Formation (Option A): Creation of a new family unit (e.g., marriage/cohabitation beginning a household); not applicable here because the family already exists.

Functions: ○ Enhances intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate. ○ Promotes bone mineralization. ○ Modulates immune function.  Deficiency Effects: ○ In children → Rickets: bowed legs, rachitic rosary, widening of wrists/ankles, delayed closure of fontanelle. ○ In adults → Osteomalacia.  Risk Factors: ○ Diet lacking in dairy/fortified foods. ○ Limited sunlight exposure. ○ Malabsorption syndromes.  Prevention: ○ Adequate sunlight exposure. ○ Vitamin D supplementation in high-risk groups. Feature Rickets (Children) Osteomalacia (Adults) Cause Vitamin D deficiency Vitamin D deficiency Bone deformities Yes (bow legs, knock knees) No deformity, bone pain Growth plate Affected Not affected Vitamin A (Option A) – Deficiency causes night blindness, xerophthalmia; unrelated to bone deformities. Vitamin B12 (Option B) – Deficiency leads to megaloblastic anemia and neurological symptoms; not linked to rickets.

    "explanation": "​ Correct Option: A) Distance between two opposite lands Explanation: In forensic ballistics, &quot;caliber&quot; refers to the diameter of a rifled firearm&#39;s barrel, specifically measured between opposing lands. This measurement, typically expressed in inches or millimetres, is crucial for linking a bullet to a specific firearm. Rifled Firearms: Rifled firearms have a bore characterised by a series of grooves that spiral along the barrel&#39;s length. These grooves (Option B), known as &quot;rifling,&quot; alternate with raised areas called &quot;lands.&quot; The caliber is determined by measuring the distance between these lands. (Option A) The direction of rifling can be either right (clockwise) or left (counter-clockwise), with most handguns featuring a right-hand twist. As the bullet travels through the barrel, it engages with the lands and grooves, imparting a spin that stabilises its flight and leaves distinctive markings on the bullet, which serve as identifiers for the firearm. Number of lead pellets (Option C) Bore or Gauge: It is used for smooth bore weapons. The number of balls/pellets of equal size/weight made from 1 pound lead (454g) 12 bore = 12 balls Mass and velocity (Option D) of a projectile fired from a rifled barrel weapon are important factors in its performance, they are not used directly to determine the caliber of the weapon ​",

Catecholamines are not characteristic of carcinoid syndrome. Serum calcitonin levels (Option B): This test is used to diagnose medullary thyroid carcinoma, which is a different type of neuroendocrine tumor. Calcitonin is unlikely to be elevated in carcinoid syndrome. Serum chromogranin A (Option C): While chromogranin A can be elevated in some neuroendocrine tumors, it is not specific for carcinoid tumors and is not the diagnostic test of choice. It may be used as a supplementary marker but not for primary diagnosis.",

Incorrect Options: Cryptococcus (Option A): This fungal infection can cause meningitis or pulmonary issues in immunocompromised patients but typically presents with a more localized infection rather than bilateral infiltrates. Histoplasmosis (Option B): While it is a fungal infection common in HIV patients, it typically causes granulomas or localized lung infiltrates, not usually bilateral infiltrates.

By inhibiting these channels, ethosuximide reduces neuronal excitability in the thalamus and helps prevent these abnormal brain wave patterns, thereby controlling the seizures.

Incorrect Options: Enhances GABAergic inhibition (Option A): Drugs like benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam) and barbiturates enhance GABAergic inhibition by increasing GABA receptor activity. Ethosuximide does not primarily act on GABA receptors. Blocks sodium channels (Option C): Sodium channel blockers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine) are effective for other types of seizures, but ethosuximide does not primarily work by blocking sodium channels.

    "explanation": "​ measures how well the kidneys are filtering blood. A rate of 125 ml/min reflects optimal kidney function and is considered normal. Glomerular Filtration Rate: GFR is the rate at which plasma is filtered by the glomeruli in the kidneys. It is a key indicator of kidney function, as it shows how efficiently the kidneys are filtering wastes from the blood. The normal GFR range is around 90-120 ml/min/1.73 m&sup2; for most adults, but 125 ml/min is considered the standard average for a healthy individual. The formula to calculate GFR is: GFR=Net Filtration Pressure (NFP)&times;Filtration Coefficient (Kf) Net Filtration Pressure (NFP) is determined by the difference between the hydrostatic pressure in the glomerular capillaries and the opposing pressures in the Bowman&rsquo;s capsule and the colloid osmotic pressure of the blood. Filtration Coefficient (Kf) depends on the surface area and permeability of the glomerular capillaries. Factors affecting GFR include: Renal Blood Flow: Increased blood flow boosts GFR, while decreased blood flow reduces it. Hydrostatic and Osmotic Pressures: High glomerular capillary pressure increases GFR, whereas high pressure in Bowman&rsquo;s capsule or elevated colloid osmotic pressure decreases it. Constriction of Afferent and Efferent Arterioles: Constriction of afferent arterioles reduces GFR, while constriction of efferent arterioles can increase GFR. Hormonal and Neural Controls: Various hormones like angiotensin II and conditions like sympathetic nervous system activation can modulate GFR by affecting blood flow and pressure within the kidneys.",

    "explanation": "​ of a substance in the urine, V is the urine flow rate, and P is the concentration of the substance in the plasma, represents the renal clearance of that substance. It quantifies the volume of plasma from which the substance is completely removed per unit time. Clearance measures the volume of plasma completely cleared of a substance by the kidneys per minute (mL/min), reflecting renal excretory efficiency. It is essential for evaluating kidney function, including filtration, reabsorption, and secretion processes. To calculate the clearance rate (Cs) of the substance, use the formula: Clearance Formula: (Cs) = (Us x V) / Ps Us: Urine concentration of the substance V: Urine flow rate Ps: Plasma concentration of the substance Types of Clearance Measurements: Inulin Clearance Used to measure Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) as it is freely filtered but not reabsorbed or secreted. Not ideal for routine use due to intravenous administration. Creatinine Clearance Estimates GFR using creatinine, which is primarily filtered by the glomeruli. Slightly inaccurate due to tubular secretion, but practical for clinical settings. PAH Clearance Estimates Renal Plasma Flow (RPF). PAH is cleared through both glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Correction for PAH extraction ratio improves accuracy. Filtration (Option A): This process refers to the initial filtration of blood through the glomerulus to form filtrate. The formula ​ does not measure this process directly. Tubular Secretion (Option B): This is the process by which substances are actively transported from the blood into the renal tubules. The formula does not specifically measure tubular secretion.

It requires a special vaporizer (tec 6) for precise anesthetic control. {{caption_text}} Tec 6 Blood gas coefficient indicates speed of onset and recovery, solubility of inhalational agent in the blood. It is inversely proportional to speed of onset High B/G has a slow onset Low B/G has a fast onset Desflurane has similar blood-gas partition co-efficient similar to Nitrous oxide. Uses Desflurane is ideal for rapid induction and emergence due to its low blood solubility, but it is not suitable for inhalation induction due to its pungency and airway irritation. C/I It should be avoided in patients with severe hypovolemia, malignant hyperthermia, and intracranial hypertension. Systemic Effects Cardiovascular Desflurane decreases systemic vascular resistance and arterial blood pressure. It causes moderate increases in heart rate, central venous pressure, and pulmonary artery pressure, particularly during rapid concentration increases, which can be managed with fentanyl, esmolol, or clonidine. Respiratory Causes decreased tidal volume and increased respiratory rate. It is pungent and can cause airway irritation, making it unsuitable for inhalation induction. Hepatic Minimal metabolism and risk of anesthetic-induced hepatitis, with maintained hepatic oxygen delivery. Renal Minimal nephrotoxicity, but decreases in urine output and glomerular filtration occur with reduced cardiac output. Neuromuscular Desflurane causes a dose-dependent decrease in neuromuscular response, enhancing the effects of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers.

To establish a defence of insanity, it must be proven that the accused, at the time of the act, had a mental disease that prevented them from understanding the nature of the act or recognising it as wrong. Legal Test of Insanity (Right or Wrong Test): A person is not criminally responsible if they did not know the nature of their act or that it was wrong at the time of the crime. Requirements include: Evidence of a mental disease. The mental disease must be present at the time of the crime. The condition must be severe enough to prevent understanding that the act is wrong or illegal. Criminal responsibility of insane persons rules: Durham&rsquo;s Rule (1954): An accused is not criminally responsible if their unlawful act results from a mental disease or defect.

    "explanation": "​ (SE) is defined as continuous seizures or repetitive, discrete seizures with impaired consciousness lasting more than 30 minutes. They are generally of 2 types: Generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) GCSE is an emergency and must be treated immediately (e.g., persistent, generalized electrographic seizures, coma, and tonic-clonic movements). Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) E.g., persistent absence seizures or focal seizures with confusion or partially impaired consciousness, and minimal motor abnormalities. In the case of impending and early SE, the standard protocol involves administering IV lorazepam 0.1 mg/kg followed by levetiracetam 20-30 mg/kg. For established and early refractory SE, the treatment progresses to Propofol 2 mg/kg IV followed by 2-10 mg/kg/hr with the addition of anticonvulsants like levetiracetam. Management of Status Epilepticus: Valproate followed by gabapentin (Option B): While valproate can be used in the treatment of GTCS, this combination is not the standard first-line treatment for status epilepticus. Gabapentin is typically used for chronic seizure management rather than acute status epilepticus. Carbamazepine followed by lorazepam (Option C): Carbamazepine is primarily used in the treatment of partial or focal seizures and is not appropriate for acute status epilepticus. Additionally, benzodiazepines should be administered first in status epilepticus, not after other anticonvulsants. Levetiracetam followed by valproate (Option D): This sequence is incorrect as benzodiazepines (lorazepam) should be the first-line treatment in early status epilepticus.",

This type of fracture often involves both the tibia and fibula. Classification of Tibial Plateau Fracture The tibial plateau refers to the proximal tibial surface, which comprises the medial and lateral articular surfaces of the respective tibial condyles. Lateral tibial plateau fractures are the most common. Mechanism of Injury The main mechanism of injury is a varus or valgus force, with or without axial load. Young Adults: Road traffic accidents, leading to split fractures (high ligament injury risk). Elderly: Trivial falls, causing depression or split depression fractures (associated with osteoporosis) (low ligament injury risk). Classification (Schatzker) Type I: Lateral plateau split fracture (young adults). Type II: Lateral plateau split depression (young adults). Type III: Lateral plateau pure depression (elderly). Type IV: Medial plateau fracture. Type V: Bicondylar fracture. Type VI: Dissociation of metaphysis and diaphysis. Clinical Features Knee swelling due to hemarthrosis. Inability to bear weight Reduce range of knee movements Compartment syndrome (earliest sign: stretch pain). Imaging X-ray: Initial fracture detection. {{caption_text}} {{caption_text}} {{caption_text}} CT with 3D Reconstruction: Gold standard. MRI: To assess ligament injuries. Management Non-surgical: Stable fractures with minimal displacement. Surgical (ORIF): For displaced fractures or significant depression. Ligament reconstruction if needed. Patella sleeve fracture (Options B) This injury generally occurs from direct trauma to the front of the knee or from a fall, and while possible in road traffic accidents, it is less likely in this case where the deformity and mechanism suggest lateral tibial plateau involvement. Depressed skull fracture (Options C) Typically caused by small objects impacting the skull at high velocity. Cervical fracture (Options D) do not involve fracture of both tibia and fibula.",

Non-Haem iron: It is found in plant-based foods such as cereals, green leafy vegetables, legumes, nuts, oilseeds, jaggery, and dried fruits. Additional Iron Sources: Cooking in iron vessels can significantly contribute to dietary iron in some areas. Iron Content in Milk: Low in all mammalian species. Breast milk contains less than 0.2 mg/dL but has good bioavailability. Bioavailability and Absorption Inhibitors: Non-haem iron absorption is hindered by phytates, oxalates, carbonates, phosphates, and dietary fibre. Foods like milk, eggs, and tea also inhibit iron absorption. Indian vegetarian diets often contain high levels of these inhibitors (e.g., phytates in bran, phosphates in egg yolk, tannin in tea, and oxalates in vegetables).

Firm, small nodules with a homogeneous grey-white to yellow cut surface. Histology The tumour cells resemble their normal counterparts. They are large in size and have round or polygonal cell outlines, abundant granular eosinophilic cytoplasm, and a round central nucleus. The cytoplasm frequently contains lipid droplets, vacuoles, or lipofuscin pigment and, most characteristically, rod-shaped Reinke crystalloids (25% of the tumours). The tumour cells are arranged in distinctive trabeculae that tend to form cord-like structures and tubules. Image {{caption_text}} {{caption_text}} Incorrect Options: Spermatocytic tumors (Option A) are typically benign and present with a painless testicular mass. They are usually diagnosed in older men (over 50 years of age) and are characterised by a slow-growing mass &amp; do not secrete any hormones. Sertoli cell tumours (Option B) mostly present as painless testicular masses. They are hormonally silent but sometimes produce estrogen &amp; are less commonly associated with elevated estradiol levels compared to Leydig cell tumors. The presence of gynaecomastia along with increased testosterone makes Leydig cell tumour more likely. Granulosa cell tumours (Option C) are more commonly seen in females and are extremely rare in males. They usually present as slow-growing and non-functioning testicular mass.",
